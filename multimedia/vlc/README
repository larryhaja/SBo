VLC media player is a free and open source media player and multi-
media framework written by the VideoLAN project. VLC is a portable
multimedia player, encoder, and streamer supporting many audio and
video codecs and file formats as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various
streaming protocols. It is able to stream over networks and to
transcode multimedia files and save them into various formats.

This build aims to support as many options as possible using
the SlackBuilds listed in the REQUIRES field of the vlc.info file.
No script changes are necessary to include particular options; if they
are detected at build time, they will be included. Conversely if
optional packages are not available at build time, vlc will generally
continue to build with a reduced feature set.

Support for OpenCV is temporarily disabled by default due to build error.
However it is possible to include opencv support using the somewhat
older opencv-legacy SlackBuild rather than opencv. It then needs to
be explicitly enabled by setting the the OPENCV environment variable
to "yes" e.g.
  OPENCV=yes sh vlc.SlackBuild
This requires the opencv-legacy package to be installed at build time.

Support for Wayland is a special case. It is not supported by default
but can be enabled setting the WAYLAND environment variable to "yes"
when running the SlackBuild e.g.
  WAYLAND=yes sh vlc.SlackBuild
This support also requires additional SBo packages wayland-egl and
wayland-protocols. It also depends on the qt5 package having been
built with wayland support i.e. wayland package was installed when the
qt5 package was built.
 
The vsxu SlackBuild is now optional for x86 machines; removed from
REQUIRES since it does not compile on arm machines at the moment.

Please advise the maintainer to suggest support for any further options.

*NOTES*
- the qt4 interface seems not to be working ATM so the qt5 one is
  enabled by default: this means qt5 is a new mandatory dependency
- you *need* to version-bump the libva and libva-intel-driver in
  Slackware to versions 1.7.3 for VAAPI support: as we suppose
  a standard install, "--enable-libva=no" is added between the
  configure options, instead
