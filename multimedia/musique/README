musique (cross-platform music player)

Musique is just another music player, only better.  Musique unclutters 
your music listening experience with a clean and innovative interface.

Notes:

- musique is a Qt4 application. It integrates nicely with KDE, but doesn't
  require KDE to run.

- This is not the latest version of musique. This is deliberate: version
  1.5 requires qt5. When musique notifies you that version 1.5 is available,
  click "Close". Upgrading from within the app won't work.

- The first time you run musique, it scans your music collection and
  uses the Last.fm service to get metadata about the files (meaning, it
  sends a list of all your music to a 3rd parts). This isn't optional,
  so if you have privacy concerns about it, don't bother installing
  this software.
