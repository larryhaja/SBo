GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests,
a real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

This optionally depends on orc, libass, libcdaudio, celt, libdc1394, dirac,
libdca, libdvdnav, faac, faad, flite, gsm, libkate, liblrdf, slv2,
libmms, libmodplug, libmimic, libmusicbrainz, libofa, OpenAL, opencv,
TiMidity++, soundtouch, swfdec, xvidcore, libvdpau, schroedinger,
libvpx and rtmpdump.
