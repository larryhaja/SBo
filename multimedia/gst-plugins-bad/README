GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests,
a real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

This optionally depends on OpenAL, TiMidity++, amrnb, amrwb, celt, faac,
faad2, flite, fluidsynth, gsm, libass, libcdaudio, libdc1394, libdca,
libkate, liblrdf, libmimic, libmodplug, libmusicbrainz, libofa,
libquicktime, libwebp, lv2, musepack-tools, opencv, rtmpdump,
schroedinger, soundtouch, swfdec, and xvidcore.
