# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

picard: Picard Tagger (next generation MusicBrainz tagging application)
picard:
picard: Picard is the next generation MusicBrainz tagging application. This
picard: new tagging concept is album oriented, as opposed to track/file
picard: oriented like the ClassicTagger was. Picard is written in Python,
picard: which is a cross-platform language, and makes use of cross-platform
picard: libraries - this allows the same code to run both on Windows, Linux
picard: and Mac OS X.
