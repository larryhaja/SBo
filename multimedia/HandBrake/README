HandBrake is a DVD ripping application that reads DVDs and outputs to a 
variety of video and audio formats, with options for subtitles, alternate 
data streams, presets, and control over advanced options like bitrate, 
pixel aspect ratio, deinterlacing, and so on.

The legality of ripping content from commercial DVDs may vary.

Lacking a GUI, the binary is HandBrakeCLI -- not HandBrake as you might 
otherwise expect.  To launch this application after installing, type in 
"HandBrakeCLI"  For the manual, type in "HandBrakeCLI --help"
