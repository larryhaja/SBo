HandBrake is a DVD ripping application that reads DVDs and outputs to a 
variety of video and audio formats, with options for subtitles, alternate 
data streams, presets, and control over advanced options like bitrate, 
pixel aspect ratio, deinterlacing, and so on.

The legality of ripping content from commercial DVDs may vary.

On by default, to skip building the GTK GUI, pass GUI=no to the script:

    # GUI=no sh ./HandBrake.SlackBuild


Commands
--------

* The command to launch the HandBrake GUI is `ghb`
* Without the GUI, it's `HandBrakeCLI`
