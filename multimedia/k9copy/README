k9copy is DVD backup utility which allows the copy of one or more
titles from a DVD9 to a DVD5.

Optional runtime deps are libdvdcss (for DVD Backup action),
along with mjpegtools and twolame (for DVD Author action).

Due to the lack of upstream maintainers and the ongoing changes to
ffmpeg, it might be necessary to change some of the default ffmpeg
command line options in the Encoders configuration section and/or
ffmpeg encoding might not be fully functional.
However, k9copy can use mencoder instead of ffmpeg, provided that
MPlayer is rebuilt with the required codecs (x264, xvid, lame,
libmp4v2, faac, etc.)
