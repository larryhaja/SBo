backlite provides several tools for backing up DVDs, including DVD9 to
DVD5 conversion.  

This is the Qt-only version of the KDE DVD backup utility k9copy.

Optional runtime deps are libdvdcss (for DVD Backup action),
along with mjpegtools and twolame (for DVD Author action).

Due to the lack of upstream maintainers and the ongoing changes to
ffmpeg, it might be necessary to change some of the default ffmpeg
command line options in the Encoders configuration section and/or
ffmpeg encoding might not be fully functional.
However, backlite can use mencoder instead of ffmpeg, provided that
MPlayer is rebuilt with the required codecs (x264, xvid, lame,
libmp4v2, faac, etc.)
