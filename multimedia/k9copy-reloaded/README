K9copy-reloaded is a continuation of the original k9copy program.
It allows you to make 1:1 backups of both single-and dual-layer
DVDs, as well as compress a dual-layer DVD to single-layer.

NOTE 1: This script builds an internal copy of the ffmpeg 2.8.13
static libaries.  It has been tested and does not (should not?)
interfere with any existing ffmpeg installation.  Just remember that
you need to be in a full shell (su - and not just su) for ffmpeg
to build properly.

NOTE 2: K9copy-reloaded is unable to open .iso files on 32-bit systems.
This is an issue with libdvdread and not with k9copy-reloaded.
They open just fine on 64-bit systems.

NOTE 3: This program is only intended for personal backups, and is NOT
intended for copying of copyrighted commercial DVDs.  Therefore, there
is NO CSS decription libary included in this package.
