Lightspark is an open source Flash player implementation for playing
files in SWF format. Lightspark can run as a web browser plugin or as
a standalone application.

Lightspark supports SWF files written on the newest version of the
ActionScript language, ActionScript 3.0, which was introduced at the
same time as Flash player 9.

Lightspark can be built with either pulseaudio and/or sdl as an audio
backend.

By default both the pulseaudio and sdl backends will be built.

To build with sdl but not pulseaudio:
  AUDIO="sdl" ./lightspark.SlackBuild

To build with pulseaudio but not sdl:
  AUDIO="pulseaudio" ./lightspark.SlackBuild

Optional dependency: gnash can optionally be used as fallback support.
