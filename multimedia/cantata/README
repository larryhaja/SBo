Cantata is a feature-rich graphical client for MPD.

The download is from google drive, which when downloaded with wget
results in ugly filenames. The slackbuild checks for either the
"normal" filename or the ugly one, and uses the one it finds.

You can use VERSION=svn to pull the sources directly from the svn.

Cantata can be build with some additional features. See the SlackBuild for
information on how to enable them.
