Cantata is a feature-rich graphical client for MPD.

The tarball in the .info file is created from the SVN found at
http://cantata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
and is not officially hosted by the cantata developers. If you are
uncomfortable with this, you can use VERSION=svn to pull the sources
directly from the svn.

Cantata can be build with some additional features.
See the SlackBuild for information on how to enable them.
