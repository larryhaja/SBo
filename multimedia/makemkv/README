MakeMKV converts video that you own into a free and patents-
unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. It converts the
video clips from proprietary (and usually encrypted) discs into a set
of MKV files, preserving most information but not changing it in any
way. MakeMKV can also instantly stream decrypted video without
intermediate conversion to a wide range of players, so you may watch
Blu-ray and DVD discs with your favorite player on your favorite OS
or on your favorite device.

See README.issues for further discussion of MakeMKV.
