SMTube is an application that allows to browse, search and play YouTube
videos. Videos are played back with a media player (by default SMPlayer)
instead of a flash player, this allows better performance, particularly
with HD content.

If you prefer to build SMTube against Qt5 rather than Qt4, install qt5 and
qt5-webkit (both available from SlackBuilds.org) and run the script like that:

  USE_QT5=yes ./smplayer.SlackBuild
