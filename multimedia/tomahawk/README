tomahawk (music player)

A new kind of music player that invites all your streams, downloads,
cloud music storage, playlists, radio stations and friends to the same
party. It's about time they all mingle.

QT5 Warning:
	If you have Qt5 installed, you will need to add the following cmake
	configure flag to the qtkeychain SlackBuild as qtkeychain builds
	with Qt5 by default if it's found. The Qt5 interface to Tomahawk is
	experimental and not yet complete.

-DBUILD_WITH_QT4="ON"

This will require gst-plugins-ugly for mp3 support

This optionally requires:

Telepathy-Qt: Telepathy-Qt is needed for sharing Jabber/GTalk accounts
              with Telepathy.

KDE4: Provides support for configuring Telepathy Accounts from inside
      Tomahawk.
