svkbd (simple virtual keyboard)

This is a simple virtual keyboard, intended to be used in environments
where no keyboard is available.

Configuration is done at build time. The font and colors can be set in
config.h (in the same directory as the SlackBuild). The key layouts
are set with the environment variable LAYOUTS, which can be set to
a space-separated list of one or more of:

en - English (QWERTY, the default)
arrows - Arrow keys only
de - German (QWERTZ)
ru - Russian (Cyrillic)
sh - Slavic (QWERTZ)
all -  All of the above

Default value for LAYOUTS is "en".

The package will contain binaries for each layout (e.g. svkbd-en,
svkbd-ru) in /usr/bin. The first layout listed in LAYOUTS (or svkbd-en
if LAYOUTS="all") will also be symlinked to /usr/bin/svkbd.
