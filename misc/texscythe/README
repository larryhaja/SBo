texscythe (TeX Live texmf subsetter)

texscythe is used to split the TeX Live tarballs into smaller and
and more efficient/manageable/logical chunks for packagers and
distributors.

texscythe was written and is maintained by Edd Barrett, the
OpenBSD TeX Live port maintainer.

See the contrib/ directory to learn how the TeX Live package lists
for SlackBuilds.org were generated.
