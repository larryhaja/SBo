Fcitx [ˈfaɪtɪks] is an input method framework with extension support.
Currently it supports linux and Unix system, like freebsd. It has three
builtin Input Method Engine, Pinyin, QuWei and Table-based input methods.

By default, this slackbuild will build IM module support for GTK2, GTK3
and Qt.

If you have installed OpenCC, you may run as below to make fcitx
support them:
# OPENCC=On ./fcitx.SlackBuild
