Fcitx is an input method framework with extension support. Currently it
supports linux and Unix systems, like freebsd. It has three builtin
Input Method Engine, Pinyin, QuWei and Table-based input methods.

By default, this slackbuild will build IM module support for GTK2, GTK3
and Qt4.

To enable OpenCC support for chinese input, you can pass OPENCC=On to
the script:

  OPENCC=On ./fcitx.SlackBuild

To enable fcitx put the following lines in your ~/.bashrc file

export GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
export XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx
export QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx

fcitx is pre-configured to autostart on xdg-compliant desktop environments
if these settings are present. On other desktop environments you can add
"fcitx-autostart" to the respective autostart settings.
