zyGrib is a program to download and visualize meteorological forecast data in
the standard formats GRIB 1 and 2. The available datasets include NOAA-GFS
(weather and wind conditions, above ground and at altitude) and FNMOC-WW3 (wave
conditions). It is possible to create animations from the forecast data of the
selected region and to export them as a set of images.

The available data include:

- Mean sea level pressure
- Wind 10m above surface
- Wind gusts
- Temperature 2m above surface
- Minimum and maximum temperature 2m above surface
- Relative humidity 2m above surface
- Total precipitation (mm/h)
- Cloud cover (%)
- Dew point 2m above surface
- 0 deg C isotherm
- Snow (rain-snow line and snowfall risk)
- CAPE (convective available potential energy) and CIN (convective inhibition)
- Data at altitude (wind, temperature, theta-e, geopotential altitude, relative
  humidity) at 925, 850, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300 and 200 hPa levels
- Atmospheric sounding forecast displayed on SkewT-LogP thermodynamic diagrams
- Waves (height, direction, period, whitecap probability for wind waves, swell,
  and for significant, maximum, primary and secondary waves)
- Sea currents (not provided by zyGrib's data server)

The zyGrib source package ships with the code for Qwt (an extension library for
QT) and NOAA's g2clib (decoder/encoder routines for GRIB 2): both are built
automatically and linked statically: this will not affect already installed
libraries.

zyGrib is distributed under the GNU GPL, version 3.
