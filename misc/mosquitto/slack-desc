# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mosquitto: Mosquitto is an open source implementation of a server for version 3
mosquitto: of the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. IBM have a
mosquitto: closed source version of this server known as Really Small Message
mosquitto: Broker (RSMB). The plan is to make mosquitto a more or less drop in
mosquitto: replacement for RSMB.
