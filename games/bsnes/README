bsnes is an emulator that began development on 2004-10-14. The
purpose of this emulator is a bit different from others: it
focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and clean code.

The emulator does not focus on things that would hinder accuracy.
This includes speed and game-specific hacks for compatibility. As
a result, the minimum system requirements for bsnes are very high.

Options:
1) Bsnes now has 2 interfaces to choose from.  The default is GTK
and the other is QT.  If you'd like to choose the QT interface,
then pass INTERFACE=qt to the slackbuild.

2) There are 3 modes that bsnes can be built.  The 3 modes can no
longer be chosen from within the game.  There can only be one mode
chosen at build time.  The 3 modes are compatibility (default),
accuracy, and performance.  To choose accuracy modes
pass PROFILE=accuracy to the slackbuild.  For performance
mode pass PROFILE=performance to the slackbuild.

Once installed, you will need to copy /usr/share/bsnes/profile/*
into ~/.config/bsnes/ before running.
