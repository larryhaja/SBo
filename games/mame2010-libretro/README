Late 2010 version of MAME (0.139) for libretro. Compatible
with MAME 0.139 romsets.

MAME originally stood for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.

MAME's purpose is to preserve decades of software history.
As electronic technology continues to rush forward, MAME
prevents this important "vintage" software from being lost
and forgotten.
