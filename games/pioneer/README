Pioneer is a space adventure game set in the Milky Way galaxy at the turn of
the 31st century.

The game is open-ended, and you are free to explore the millions of star
systems in the game. You can land on planets, slingshot past gas giants, and
burn yourself to a crisp flying between binary star systems. You can try your
hand at piracy, make your fortune trading between systems, or do missions for
the various factions fighting for power, freedom or self-determination.

OpenGL core profile version 3.1 or newer is a runtime dependency, to determine
what version of OpenGL is installed use:

  glxinfo | grep "core profile version"

Note: If you have intel or amd GPU with free drivers, it is recommended
to install libtxc_dxtn as well.

Pioneer's game data needs around 400M of hard drive space.  By default, the
game data is installed in /usr/share/games/pioneer.  The SlackBuild allows
choosing an alternate game data directory using the DATADIR option.  For
example, to install the data in
/opt/pioneer --

  DATADIR=/opt ./pioneer.SlackBuild

To build with debugging support use:

  DEBUG="yes" ./pioneer.SlackBuild
