Gearboy is a Nintendo Game Boy / GameBoy Color emulator written in C++.

Optional dependencies:
  qt5, RetroArch and SDL2

At least some of the optional dependencies will be required to use
Gearboy. If qt5 and SDL2 are not installed the standalone frontend
will not be built and only the libretro core will be built. RetroArch
will be required to run the libretro core in this case.

To build the debugging symbols for the libretro core use:
  DEBUG=1 ./Gearboy.SlackBuild
