Koules is a fast action arcade-style game for UNIX and OS/2. This version
supports X window system, SVGAlib  for Linux and OS/2. It works in fine
(up to 900x620) resolution with cool 256 color graphics, multiplayer mode
up to 5 players, full sound and, of course, network support. Koules is
an original idea.  First version of Koules was developed from scratch
by Jan Hubicka in July 1995.

Yes, koules used to packaged on disk y1 of Slackware 3.3. It needed
quite a bit of patching to work well on a modern system...

If you're building this for use on a slow system, try setting MITSHM=yes
in the environment; it may speed things up (or not).

The build patches koules to use ALSA for audio. If you want to disable
the patch and use OSS, set ALSA=no in the environment (probably only
useful if you use OSSv4).

If you have Tcl/Tk installed, and you're running KDE, you'll get a nice
GUI launcher dialog when you run Koules from the K menu. If you're not
running KDE, try running "koules-launcher".

Note: When playing as player #2 in multiplayer, the default keys are WASD,
not the arrows (this is confusing). Players 3 and above don't seem to
have default key maps, so be sure to configure the keys before starting
the game (or set the control type to mouse or joystick instead).
