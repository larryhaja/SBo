zoom (play interactive fiction games)

Zoom is a player for Z-Code, TADS and HUGO stories or games. These are
usually text adventures ('interactive fiction'), and were first created
by Infocom with the Zork series of games. Throughout the 80's, Infocom
released many interactive fiction stories before their ambitions to
enter the database market finally brought them low.
