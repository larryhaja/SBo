# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libretro-yabause: libretro-yabause (Yabause port for libretro)
libretro-yabause:
libretro-yabause: Yabause (Yet Another Buggy And Uncomplete Saturn Emulator) is the
libretro-yabause: only active Sega Saturn emulator that is both open-source and written
libretro-yabause: with portability in mind. The libretro port only supports the software
libretro-yabause: renderer at the moment, which is more accurate but also slower than
libretro-yabause: the GL renderer.
