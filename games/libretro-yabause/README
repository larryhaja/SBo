Yabause is a Sega Saturn video game system emulator that can be used as a
libretro core.

Yabause (Yet Another Buggy And Uncomplete Saturn Emulator) is the only active
Sega Saturn emulator that is both open-source and written with portability in
mind. The libretro port only supports the software renderer at the moment,
which is more accurate but also slower than the GL renderer.

Yabause optionally supports usage of an actual Saturn BIOS image file for
increased compatibility:

* saturn_bios.bin

Any kind Saturn BIOS file should be good to go.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./libretro-yabause.SlackBuild
