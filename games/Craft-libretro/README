Minecraft clone ported to the Libretro API. Just a few thousand lines
of C using modern OpenGL (shades).

Craft can be started from the RetroArch menu or from the command line with:
  retroarch -L /usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}/libretro/craft_libretro.so

If your gamepad is experiencing issues with uncontrolable spinning or
automatic movement try raising the 'Analog deadzone size' value in the
craft game options.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./Craft-libretro.SlackBuild
