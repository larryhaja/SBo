fMSX is a program that emulates MSX, MSX2, and MSX2+ 8bit home computers.

fMSX optionally supports using the following BIOS image file for operation:

* MSX.ROM (MSX BIOS)
* MSX2.ROM (MSX2 BIOS)
* MSX2EXT.ROM (MSX2 ExtROM)
* MSX2P.ROM (MSX2+ BIOS)
* MSX2PEXT.ROM (MSX2+ ExtROM)

The BIOS images are included with the  fsmx-libretro source tree in the
fMSX/ROMs directory.
