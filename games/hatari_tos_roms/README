TOS (Tramiel Operating System) ROM images for use with hatari.
Versions 1.02 and 2.06 included.

These images are copyrighted by Atari, Inc. It may be illegal to
install this package in your jurisdiction!

On the other hand, they're freely available on various web sites,
and have been for many years with no legal action taken.

The SlackBuild script requires the UK ROM images, which are sufficient
for most uses. A few games and demos, however, will require the US ROM
versions. If the file tos_us.zip is present in the directory with the
SlackBuild, these ROMs will be included in the package as well. Get
them from:

The hatari emulator will use /usr/share/hatari/tos.img by default. This
package creates a symlink from tos-1.02-uk.img to tos.img, so the
emulator will use this ROM image. To use a different ROM, either change
the symlink or give the ROM image location on the hatari command line.
