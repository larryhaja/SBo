snes9x (Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator)

Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES
and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation. The
games include some real gems that were only ever released in Japan.

If you're upgrading from snes9x-1.55, you'll have to delete your old
config file:

  rm -rf ~/.snes9x

Apologies for any inconvenience.

Also, with 1.56.1, you might notice some user interface differences. This
is because 1.55 used GTK+-3.0, but 1.56 and newer require a version of
GTK+-3.0 that's newer than Slackware 14.2 provides. So, starting with
1.56, this build uses the GTK+-2.0 UI.
