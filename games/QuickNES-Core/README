QuickNES is a Nintendo Entertainment System video game system emulator
that can be used as a libretro core.

Nes_Emu, the core NES emulator library used by QuickNES, began as a
very simple NES emulator sometime in 2004. It was based on the 6502 CPU
core and APU sound core used in the Game_Music_Emu sound engine.
