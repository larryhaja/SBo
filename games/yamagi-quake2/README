This is an enhanced client for Id Software's legendary Quake II.  It focuses on
single-player. Features include rock-solid stability and AMD64 support.

This only installs the Yamagi-Quake2 source port. Before playing it, you need
to copy your Quake2 data files into the appropriate subdirectories of
/usr/share/quake2.  Please refer to the README files in
/usr/doc/yamagi-quake2-5.11/ for details.

To get a reasonable default configuration, copy
/usr/doc/yamagi-quake2-5.11/yq2.cfg to your baseq2 directory.
