sms_sdl (A Sega Master System and Game Gear Emulator)

SMS Plus is Sega Master System and Game Gear emulator. Originally,
it was written to run under DOS. Since Charles Mac Donald released
his emulator under the GPL terms, this emulator has been ported to
different platforms.

This package includes desktop integration for KDE4. IF you do not want
this, specify MIME_TYPES=no in the environment before running the script.
The desktop integration associates *.sms and *.gg files with the emulator,
so they will be displayed with a Sega Master System icon, and can be
launched from within KDE by clicking on them in the file manager.
