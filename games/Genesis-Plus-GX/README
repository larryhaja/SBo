Genesis Plus GX is an open-source Sega 8/16 bit emulator focused on
accuracy and portability.

The source code, initially based on Genesis Plus 1.2a by Charles
MacDonald has been heavily modified & enhanced, with respect to
original goals and design, in order to improve emulation accuracy as
well as adding support for new peripherals, cartridge or console
hardware and many other exciting features.

The result is that Genesis Plus GX is now more a continuation of the
original project than a simple port, providing very accurate emulation
and 100% compatibility with Genesis / Mega Drive, Sega/Mega CD, Master
System, Game Gear & SG-1000 released software (including all unlicensed
or pirate known dumps), also emulating backwards compatibility modes
when available.

Genesis Plus GX supports usage of actual BIOS image files rather than
emulating them. Only Sega CD/Mega CD emulation requires a real BIOS to
work. It is recommended to use a BIOS from a Model 1 system, but others
are expected to work too.

* bios_CD_E.bin (MegaCD EU BIOS)
* bios_CD_U.bin (SegaCD US BIOS)
* bios_CD_J.bin (MegaCD JP BIOS)
* bios_E.sms (MasterSystem EU BIOS)
* bios_U.sms (MasterSystem US BIOS)
* bios_J.sms (MasterSystem JP BIOS)
* bios.gg (GameGear BIOS)
* sk.bin (Sonic & Knuckles (2 MiB) ROM)
* sk2chip.bin (Sonic & Knuckles UPMEM (256 KiB) ROM)
* areplay.bin (Action Replay (Pro) ROM)
* ggenie.bin (Game Genie ROM)
