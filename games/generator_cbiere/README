generator_cbiere (Sega Genesis/MegaDrive emulator)

This is a modified version of Generator, by James Ponder, based on
version 0.35.

Notes:

1. the binary is installed as /usr/games/generator-gtk.

2. press Control-F to get out of fullscreen mode.

3. By default, the emulator is built with the "raze" (x86 assembly
   language) CPU core on 32-bit x86 platforms, and "cmz80" (written in C)
   on other platforms. If you for some reason want to use cmz80 on x86,
   export Z80CORE=cmz80 in the script's environment.
