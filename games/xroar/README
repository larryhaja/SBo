xroar (emulator for 6809-based systems)

XRoar is a Dragon emulator for Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, GP32, Nintendo
DS and Windows. Due to hardware similarities, XRoar also emulates the
Tandy Colour Computer (CoCo) models 1 & 2.

Optional dependenies:

gtkglext - if you want a full GTK+ user interface, install gtkglext
   before building xroar.

jack-audio-connection-kit - if you want to use JACK for audio output,
   install jack-audio-connection-kit and set JACK=yes in the
   environment before building xroar. If JACK audio has x-runs,
   try 'setcap cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_nice=ep /usr/bin/xroar'.

To usefully emulate the Dragon or CoCo, you will need the images of
the system ROMs for the target system. The ROM images must be copied to
/usr/share/xroar/roms, and must be given the filenames xroar expects. See
the xroar info page or /usr/doc/xroar-$VERSION/xroar.html for details
on ROM files.

If you want to include ROM images in the package, get the files
"coco.zip", "coco2.zip", "cocoe.zip", "dragon32.zip", and/or
"dragon64.zip" from any site that carries MESS BIOS images. Place them
in the directory with the SlackBuild script before running it. The
resulting package cannot be redistributed (that would violate both the
GPL and the original copyright on the ROM images).

If you don't include the ROM images, it's still possible to run
some Dragon32 software: the package includes a freeware ROM image
(mini-dragon.rom) that partly reimplements the original ROM code. This
is enough to run at least some cartridge-based games.
