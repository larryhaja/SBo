Nestopia is a Nintendo Entertainment System video game system emulator that can
be used as a libretro core.

Nestopia is a portable and cycle-accurate NES/Famicom emulator written in C++.
Nestopia UE (Undead Edition) is a fork of the original source code, with
enhancements from members of the emulation community. This includes support for
new platforms, and bug fixes in the emulator core.

Nestopia requires the following BIOS image files for operation:

* DISKSYS.ROM (Famicom Disk System BIOS)
* NstDatabase.xml (NES Database)

The NstDatabase.xml can be copied from the nestopia-libretro documentation
directory:
  cp /usr/doc/nestopia-libretro-$VERSION/NstDatabase.xml \
     /your/RetroArch/bios/direcotry

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./nestopia-libretro.SlackBuild
