Hatari is an Atari ST and STE emulator for Linux, BSD, BeOS, Mac OS X and
other systems that are supported by the SDL library. The Atari ST was a
16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari in 1985. Using
the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having quite a lot
of CPU power at that time.

Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the
hardware of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most
of the old ST games and demos.

Recommended dependency: hatari_tos_roms. hatari includes a free
replacement called EmuTOS, but most users will want to install the real
ROM images. Most ST software won't work without hatari_tos_roms.

Optional dependency: portaudio. Only used for emulated Falcon microphone
support. Autotetected by the SlackBuild.

Optional dependency: SDL2. Autodetected. If you have SDL2 installed but
want to build hatari with SDL-1.2, set SDL2=no in the environment.
