Hatari is an Atari ST and STE emulator for Linux, BSD, BeOS, Mac OS X and
other systems that are supported by the SDL library. The Atari ST was a
16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari in 1985. Using
the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer having quite a lot
of CPU power at that time.

Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the
hardware of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most
of the old ST games and demos.

Optional dependency: if portaudio is installed, hatari will be built
with it, which enables emulated Falcon microphone support.

Before you can actually run the emulator, you also need a TOS image
file. TOS is the built-in operating system of the Atari 16/32 bit
computers. Since it is not possible to ship one of these image files
with Hatari, you either have to create your own image from your Atari
or you have to use EmuTOS, a free TOS replacement.

It's also possible to download the ROM images from the net. See
the package hatari_tos_roms. If you're going to install the ROMs,
it's easiest to install hatari first, then hatari_tos_roms (otherwise,
you'll have to manually symlink /usr/share/hatari/tos.img to whichever
ROM you want to use).

EmuTOS is included in this package, so you can run at least some ST
applications without installing the real ROMs, but not many programs
work with EmuTOS (especially not games).
