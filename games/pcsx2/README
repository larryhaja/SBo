PCSX2 is an open source Playstation 2 emulator. Its purpose is to mimic
the PS2 hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU Interpreters, Recompilers
and a Virtual Machine which manages hardware states and PS2 system memory.

NOTE: This is buildable only on x86 32bit platform and will require a PS2 bios dump
to play games. For x86_64 64bit platforms multilib support will be needed including
compat32 versions of SDL2, wxGTK3, portaudio, soundtouch, libnotify and xz.

To build a legacy GSdx plugin compatible with GL3.3 use:

  GL3="yes" ./pcsx2.SlackBuild
