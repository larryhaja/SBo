Mupen64Plus is a cross-platform plugin-based N64 emulator which is capable of
accurately playing many games.

Vulkan can be used instead of opengl. This will require both a video card and
driver that support it, but Slackware does not yet provide any Vulkan support,
so providing the correct build environment is up to you.
To build with Vulkan use:
  VULKAN=1 ./mupen64plus.SlackBuild

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./mupen64plus-libretro.SlackBuild
