Changes to this SlackBuild since FGo! 1.4.5
-------------------------------------------

* Script modified according to new icon names and paths. If you are building
  a package for a version of FGo! older than 1.5.0, icons will not be linked
  correctly: in that case please modify this script accordingly, or use its
  previous version, or (recommended) download the latest FGo! release.

* Removed presets for default FlightGear paths, as they are not included in
  the upstream package anyway.

* 1.5.1, build 2: revision and cleanup.

* 1.5.2: version update (new Japanese localization).

* 1.5.4: version update, revision and cleanup. Removed 'fgo.desktop' from the
  package, as it was moved to the FGo! upstream release. Modified symlinking
  to icons, according to their new location.

* 1.5.5: version update.
