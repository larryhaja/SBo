FGo! is a simple and fast graphical front end for FlightGear, written
in Python by Robert Leda. It combines a simple graphical interface,
where users can select an aircraft, airport, runway, parking position
and scenario, with a text window which provides a way to specify more
advanced command-line options that will be passed to FlightGear. These
features allow FGo! to keep a simple, yet powerful design.

NOTE: FGo! versions equal or greater than 1.5.0 are compatible with
FlightGear 3.0 and its new apt.dat database format. If you intend to use
this SlackBuild for a version of FGo! older than 1.5.0, please read the
CHANGELOG file included in this package.
