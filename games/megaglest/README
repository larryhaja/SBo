MegaGlest is a free open source 3D real-time strategy game where 
you control the armies of one of seven different factions:  Tech, 
Magic, Egyptians, Indians, Norsemen, Persian or Romans.  The game 
is setup in one of 16 naturally looking settings, which (like the 
unit models) are crafted with great appreciation for detail.

Optional dependencies are libircclient, miniupnpc and vlc, as well
as help2man if you want to build man pages.

Note to parallel builders: don't user more than 2 jobs or build
will break.
