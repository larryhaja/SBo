PPSSPP is an PlayStation Portable video game system emulator that can be used
as a libretro core.

PPSSPP requires the asset files from the assets directory and both the flash0
and lang directories from the PPSSPP source tree to be placed in the
system/PPSSPP directory for operation.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./libretro-ppsspp.SlackBuild
