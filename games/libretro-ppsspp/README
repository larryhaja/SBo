PPSSPP is an PlayStation Portable video game system emulator that can
be used as a libretro core.

PPSSPP requires the contents of the assets directory from the PPSSPP
source tree to be placed in the system/PPSSPP directory for operation.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./libretro-ppsspp.SlackBuild
