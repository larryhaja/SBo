RetroArch is the reference frontend for the libretro API. Popular
examples of implementations for this API includes videogame system
emulators and game engines, but also more generalized 3D programs.
These programs are instantiated as dynamic libraries. We refer to these
as "libretro cores".

libretro is an API that exposes generic audio/video/input callbacks. A
frontend for libretro (such as RetroArch) handles video output, audio
output, input and application lifecycle. A libretro core written in
portable C or C++ can run seamlessly on many platforms with very
little/no porting effort.

While RetroArch is the reference frontend for libretro, several other
projects have used the libretro interface to include support for
emulators and/or game engines. libretro is completely open and free for
anyone to use.

RetroArch will require at least one of the libretro cores to play any games.

To build debugging symbols for RetroArch use:
  DEBUG=1 ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

Some optional dependencies include:
ffmpeg jack-audio-connection-kit libxkbcommon python3 SDL2 wayland

Note: Wayland support requires mesa to be rebuilt with Wayland support,
using the following configure parameters.

  --with-egl-platforms=x11,drm,wayland

RetroArch optionally supports using Vulkan instead of opengl, but
Slackware does not yet provide any Vulkan support, so providing the
correct build environment is up to you.
