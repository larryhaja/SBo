Mednafen PSX (Beetle PSX) is a Sony PlayStation1 video game system emulator
that can be used as a libretro core. It is a libretro port of Mednafen
PlayStation.

Mednafen-PSX requires the following BIOS image files for operation:

* scph5500.bin (MD5 sum: 8dd7d5296a650fac7319bce665a6a53c) NTSC-J
* scph5501.bin (MD5 sum: 490f666e1afb15b7362b406ed1cea246) NTSC-U
* scph5502.bin (MD5 sum: 32736f17079d0b2b7024407c39bd3050) PAL

The bios names are case sensitive.

The scph7003.bin BIOS image is the same as schph5501.bin, but will need to be
renamed to schph5501.bin to be used.

Mednafen can load CD-ROM games from a ripped/dumped copy of the disc such as
CUE+BIN, CloneCD "CCD/IMG/SUB" rips and cdrdao "TOC" files. For games with more
than one CD create a M3U file(plain-text, ".m3u" extension) and enter the
filenames of the CUE/TOC/CCD files.

To build the opengl renderer use:
  OPENGL=1 ./beetle-psx-libretro.SlackBuild

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./beetle-psx-libretro.SlackBuild
