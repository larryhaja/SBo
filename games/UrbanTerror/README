UrbanTerror is an urban combat themed First Person Shooter.
Urban Terror started as a realism based "total conversion" mod for 
Quake III Arena. Nowadays, Urban Terror is played using the free, 
stand-alone, ioquake3 engine modified, which doesn't require 
Quake III Arena.

UPDATING FROM SLACKWARE 12.2 TO AN ABOVE RELEASE
If you had a previous installation under Slackware 12.2 and are using the 
same user profile, you will not be able to download maps from servers.
You will receive a message about the game not finding libcurl.so.3.
This message is received because Slackware >=13.0 are using libcurl.so.4, 
the solution to this issue is to run the following command in the terminal:
sed -i 's/libcurl.so.3/libcurl.so.4/g' $HOME/.q3a/q3ut4/q3config.cfg

This command will replace the reference in your game confguration file
with a reference to the newer libraries.

Any new profiles will automatically have the correct reference because the
primary configuration has already been altered.
