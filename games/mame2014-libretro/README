Late 2014/Early 2015 version of MAME (0.159-ish) for libretro.
Compatible with MAME 0.159 romsets.

MAME originally stood for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.

MAME's purpose is to preserve decades of software history.
As electronic technology continues to rush forward, MAME
prevents this important "vintage" software from being lost
and forgotten.

By default, this SlackBuild will build the mame2014 core.
To build the mess2014 or ume2014 cores, choose any desired cores:
  CORE="mame mess ume" ./mame2014-libretro.SlackBuild

Or to build all three cores, "all" can be used:
  CORE="all" ./mame2014-libretro.SlackBuild

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./mame2014-libretro.SlackBuild
