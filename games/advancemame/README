advancemame (Multi Arcade Machine Emulator)

Advancemame is a derivative of the well known "mame" emulator.
It works easily on linux, with joystick support, fullscreen
support, and more "out of the box."

Optional dependency: SDL2. By default, advancemame is built with
SDL-1.2. If SDL-2.0 is installed, advancemame will autodetect it and use
it instead. If you have SDL2 installed, but want to build advancemame
with SDL-1.2, set SDL2=no in the script's environment.
