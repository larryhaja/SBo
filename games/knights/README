knights (a simple chess board for KDE 4)

Knights is a rewrite of the KDE3 Knights. You can play against computer
engines that support the XBoard protocol (like GnuChess), against another
player at the same computer, or on the Free Internet Chess Server. It
has automatic rule checking and some nice animations.
