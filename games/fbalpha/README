Final Burn Alpha is an arcade system emulator that can be used as a libretro
core.

This package was previoulsy called libretro-fba.

If you are building fbalpha for a Raspberry Pi 2, use:
  RPI2="yes" ./fbalpha.SlackBuild

Final Burn Alpha may require both a parent and child romset to play games with,
rebuilding romsets so they work properly is not supported on GNU/Linux, but the
required dat files are included in the src tree.

Romsets built for FB Alpha (0.2.97.38) are recommended for best results.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./fbalpha.SlackBuild
