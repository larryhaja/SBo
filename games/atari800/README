atari800 (Atari 8-bit computer emulator)

This is free and portable Atari 8-bit computer and 5200 console emulator,
originally written by David Firth and now developed by the Atari800
Development Team. This program is copyrighted and released under the GPL.

This build uses SDL for audio, and SDL+OpenGL for video by default. To
build without OpenGL support (SDL software rendering only), set OPENGL=no
in the script's environment.

To run Atari software with atari800, you'll need the Atari system ROMs.
These are packaged on SBo as atari800_roms.
