# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

scummvm-libretro:
scummvm-libretro: ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic
scummvm-libretro: graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already
scummvm-libretro: have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just
scummvm-libretro: replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to
scummvm-libretro: play them on systems for which they were never designed!
