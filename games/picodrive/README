PicoDrive is a Sega 8/16 bit video game system emulator that can be
used as a libretro core or with the stand alone sdl frontend.

This is yet another Megadrive / Genesis / Sega CD / Mega CD / 32X / SMS
emulator, which was written having ARM-based handheld devices in mind
(such as smartphones and handheld consoles like GP2X and Pandora),
but also runs on non-ARM little-endian hardware too.

RetroArch is an optional dependency to run the libretro core.

PicoDrive requires a real BIOS for Sega CD/Mega CD emulation to work.

* bios_CD_E.bin (MegaCD EU BIOS)
* bios_CD_U.bin (SegaCD US BIOS)
* bios_CD_J.bin (MegaCD JP BIOS)

For the standalone emulator they can be placed in ~/.picodrive/ or for
the libretro core they should be placed in RetroArch's system/bios
directory.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./picodrive.SlackBuild
