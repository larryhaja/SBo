# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tyrquake-libretro: This is meant to be a fairly conservative branch of the Quake source
tyrquake-libretro: code. It's intended to support Quake and Quakeworld in both software
tyrquake-libretro: and GL versions, as well as the Quakeworld Server.
