This is meant to be a fairly conservative branch of the Quake source code. It's
intended to support Quake and Quakeworld in both software and GL versions, as
well as the Quakeworld Server; all on both MS Windows and Linux (BSD supported
as best I can manage with some help from some other users). I don't intend on
changing the look or feel of the game by adding lots of rendering enhancements,
etc, but rather just fixing little bugs that I've come across over the years.
I'll be adding small enhancements and may even rewrite substantial portions of
the code, but I don't want to change the fundamental feel of the game.

The Quake game data is needed to play and must be acquired separately.

Alternatively the shareware version of Quake can be acquired through RetroArch.
To download it go to 'Add Content' -> 'Download Content' -> 'Tyrquake'.

To play Quake place the PAK0.PAK and PAK1.PAK into your Quake data directory.
The PAK2.PAK file that was not originally included with Quake is known to crash
Tyrquake and should not be used.

The Quake Mission Packs No. 1: Scourge of Armagon and No. 2: Dissolution of
Eternity can also be played. Place pak0.pak and pak1.pk3 files for each in the
Quake game data directory, under the names hipnotic and rogue respectively.

To use the colored lighting with Tyrquake, make a subdir in your Quake data
directory called 'maps' which contains the required .lit files. They can be
downloaded with RetroArch. To do this go to 'Add Content' -> 'Download Content'
and download 'quake-colored-lighting-pack.zip' found under Tyrquake.

Controls should be set in both RetroArch and the in game configuration menu.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./tyrquake-libretro.SlackBuild
