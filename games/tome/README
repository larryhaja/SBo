ToME is a game that emphasizes intricate, challenging, and varied gameplay over
graphics. Hundreds of different monsters in randomly-generated, unpredictable
dungeons will strive to slay you by various means, and you counter - if you
survive - by developing the skills of your choice and wielding mighty
artifacts.
