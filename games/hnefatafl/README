Hnefatafl is the Norse board game. It has been played in Scandinavia
since at least 400 AD.

Hnefatafl (with any board setup) and tablut are fully supported using
rulesets. Other regional variants are partly supported.

The program has CLI and XLib interfaces. You can play hotseat or versus
a computer player, but network play is not supported.

To compile the program without XLib, invoke the script with
LINK_XLIB=no in the environment, e.g.
  LINK_XLIB=no ./hnefatafl.SlackBuild

Nearly all settings are compile-time options that can be changed in
`config.mk`, including language and the amount of memory that the
computer player may use for hashing.
