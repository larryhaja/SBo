mGBA is an emulator for running Game Boy Advance games. It aims to be
faster and more accurate than many existing Game Boy Advance
emulators, as well as adding features that other emulators lack.

Optional dependencies are:

* qt5 (for the GUI)
* SDL2
* libedit (for the command-line debugger)
* ffmpeg
