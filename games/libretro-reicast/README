Reicast is an Sega Dreamcast video game system emulator that can be used as a
libretro core.

The Dreamcast BIOS files are required to run Reicast.

* dc/dc_boot.bin
* dc/dc_flash.bin

Due to a bug in Reicast emulated memory cards will not save by default, to work
around this the following will need to be done:
  1. Start a game with libretro-reicast.
  2. Open the core options, they can be found in the RetroArch quick menu.
  3. Enable 'Boot to BIOS (restart)', then close and restart the emulator.
  4. In the Dreamcast bios menu select 'File' and reformat the memory card.
  5. Open the core options again and disable 'Boot to BIOS (restart)'.
  6. Now close and restart Reicast to enjoy a working memory card.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./libretro-reicast.SlackBuild
