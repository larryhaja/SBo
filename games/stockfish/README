Stockfish is a free UCI chess engine derived from Glaurung 2.1. It is not a
complete chess program and requires some UCI-compatible GUI (e.g. XBoard with
PolyGlot, eboard, Arena, Sigma Chess, Shredder, Chess Partner or Fritz) in
order to be used comfortably. Read the documentation for your GUI of choice
for information about how to use Stockfish with it.

This version of Stockfish supports up to 128 cores. The engine defaults to one
search thread, so it is therefore recommended to inspect the value of the
Threads UCI parameter, and to make sure it equals the number of CPU cores on
your computer.

This version of Stockfish has support for Syzygybases.
