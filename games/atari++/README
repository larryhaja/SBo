The Atari++ Emulator is a Unix based emulator of the Atari eight bit
computers, namely the Atari 400 and 800, the Atari 600XL, 800XL and 130XE,
and the Atari 5200 game console. The emulator is auto-configurable and
will compile on a variety of systems (Linux, Solaris, Irix), and supports
many emulation features.

Atari++ includes OS++, an open source replacement Atari 8-bit operating
system, so it's able to run many games and applications without the
Atari ROM images. However, for maximum compatibility, you probably will
want the original ROMs. To get them, install the atari800_roms package,
then use the atari++ GUI to set the ROM file paths to the images in
/usr/share/atari800/roms/.

Note: Atari++, by default, is built with a fancy set of CFLAGS that the
author includes in his makefile. If you're picky about such things, or if
you run into crashes or compile errors, try setting FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes
in the environment before running atari++.SlackBuild
