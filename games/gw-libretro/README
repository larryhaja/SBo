Game & Watch is a libretro core that runs Game & Watch simulators.

It runs simulators converted from source code for the games available at
MADrigal. Each simulator is converted with pas2lua, which was written
specifically for this purpose, and uses bstree, which was also specifically
written to obfuscate the generated Lua source code as per MADrigal's request.

Games for this emulator are downloadable from the RetroArch gui.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./gw-libretro.SlackBuild
