Cannonball is a program which allows you to play an enhanced version of
Yu Suzuki's seminal arcade racer, OutRun that can be used as a libretro
core.

Cannonball is not an emulator, it is a complete rewrite of the original
game into portable C++.

cannbonball-libretro requires OutRun Revision B ROMs and a dummy game
file with the '.game' prefix which should be placed in the same
directory.

For example:

  touch cannonball.game

The game can then be loaded with the dummy file.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./cannonball-libretro.SlackBuild
