fizmo (Z-Code interpreter for Infocom and other story files)

Fizmo provides a Z-Machine interpreter development library in plain C
along with a ncurses user interface, supporting Z-Machine versions 1
to 5, 7 and 8. That means it allows you to play interactive ficiton,
also known as textadventures, which were implemented either by Infocom
or created using the Inform compiler.

By default, the curses (fizmo-ncursesw) and 'dumb' console (fizmo-console)
executables are always built. If you want a GUI for fizmo, install SDL2
before running this script (the executable will be called fizmo-sdl2).
