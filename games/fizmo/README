fizmo (Z-Code interpreter for Infocom and other story files)

Fizmo provides a Z-Machine interpreter development library in plain C
along with a ncurses user interface, supporting Z-Machine versions 1
to 5, 7 and 8. That means it allows you to play interactive ficiton,
also known as textadventures, which were implemented either by Infocom
or created using the Inform compiler.
