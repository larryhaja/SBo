higan (formerly known as bsnes) is an emulator that began development 
on 2004-10-14. The purpose of this emulator is a bit different from 
others: it focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and clean 
code. The emulator does not focus on things that would hinder accuracy.
This includes speed and game-specific hacks for compatibility. As a 
result, the minimum system requirements for higan are very high.

It currently supports the following systems: Famicom (NES), Super 
Famicom (SNES), Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. 
It also supports the following subsystems: Super Game Boy, 
BS-X Satellaview and Sufami Turbo.

* Configuration *

The default profile folder (where platform system files, cheats and 
shaders are located) is /usr/share/higan. If you want a personalized
profile, store your files in ~/.config/higan/, then higan will use
this folder instead.
