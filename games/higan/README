higan (formerly known as bsnes) is an emulator that began development 
on 2004-10-14. The purpose of this emulator is a bit different from 
others: it focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and clean 
code. The emulator does not focus on things that would hinder accuracy.
This includes speed and game-specific hacks for compatibility. As a 
result, the minimum system requirements for higan are very high.

It currently supports the following systems: Famicom (NES), Super 
Famicom (SNES), Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. 
It also supports the following subsystems: Super Game Boy, 
BS-X Satellaview and Sufami Turbo.

*Options*

1) higan has 2 interfaces to choose from. The default is QT
and the other is GTK. If you'd like to choose the GTK interface,
then pass INTERFACE=gtk to the slackbuild.

2) There are 3 modes that higan can be built. There can only be one
mode chosen at build time. The 3 modes are accuracy, balanced (default),
and performance. To choose accuracy mode pass PROFILE=accuracy to 
the slackbuild. For performance mode pass PROFILE=performance to the 
slackbuild.

*Configuration*

The default profile folder (where platform system files, cheats and 
shaders are located) is /usr/share/higan. If you want a personalized
profile, store your files in ~/.config/higan/, then higan will use
this folder instead.

Since the ananke library is also built, you can import your regular
ROM game files into higan's library using the option "Import Game" in
the Library menu. When you import a rom file it will be converted into 
higan's format and saved in the Game Library Path specified in the 
Advanced Settings options (Settings -> Configuration -> Advanced). 
After that you can load your game through the correspondent system 
option in the Library menu.

If you want to use shaders, select OpenGL as the video driver.
