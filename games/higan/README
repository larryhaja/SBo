higan (formerly known as bsnes) is an emulator that began development 
on 2004-10-14. The purpose of this emulator is a bit different from 
others: it focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and clean 
code. The emulator does not focus on things that would hinder accuracy.
This includes speed and game-specific hacks for compatibility. As a 
result, the minimum system requirements for higan are very high.

It currently supports the following systems: Famicom (NES), Super 
Famicom (SNES), Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and 
Nintendo DS. It also supports the following subsystems: Super Game 
Boy, BS-X Satellaview and Sufami Turbo.

Options:
1) higan has 2 interfaces to choose from. The default is QT
and the other is GTK. If you'd like to choose the GTK interface,
then pass INTERFACE=gtk to the slackbuild.

2) There are 3 modes that higan can be built. There can only be one
mode chosen at build time. The 3 modes are accuracy, balanced (default),
and performance. To choose accuracy mode pass PROFILE=accuracy to 
the slackbuild. For performance mode pass PROFILE=performance to the 
slackbuild.

Configuration:
Once installed, you will need to copy /usr/share/higan/profile/*
into ~/.config/higan/ before running. If you want to use shaders, 
select OpenGL as the video driver.
