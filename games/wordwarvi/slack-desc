# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wordwarvi: .swp files, avoiding OS defenses, and wiping out those memory hogging
wordwarvi: emacs processes. When all the lost .swp files are rescued, head for
wordwarvi: the socket which will take you to the next node in the cluster.
