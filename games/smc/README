smc (Secret Maryo Chronicles)

Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform game
with a style designed similar to classic sidescroller games such as
Super Mario Bros. It uses the platform independent library SDL and, since
version 0.98, the OpenGL accelerated graphics renderer from CEGUI. The
game is developed in C++.

Notes:

Older versions of smc came without the music, so there used to be a
separate smc_music package. This is no longer the case: this build
includes the background music at the highest quality available.

To compile this game you will need CEGUI0.7. Make sure CEGUI0.7 is
compiled after FreeImage, as this needs a CEGUI0.7 with FreeImage support
built in (the latest CEGUI0.7 SlackBuild will automatically use FreeImage
if available).

Unfortunately, as of this writing, it's impossible to install both CEGUI
and CEGUI0.7 at the same time, so make sure CEGUI (the 0.8 version)
isn't installed or you'll end up with a mess.

If you get compile errors related to CEGUI's NullRenderer, rebuild
CEGUI0.7 using the latest SlackBuild (older ones were missing NullRenderer
support).

When running, the game emits CEGUI::InvalidRequestException messages on
its stderr. These are harmless and can be ignored: they're caused by
the CEGUI library searching for files in the current directory before
looking in the game directory at /usr/share/smc.
