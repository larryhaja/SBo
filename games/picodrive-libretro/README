PicoDrive is a Sega 8/16 bit video game system emulator that can be used as a
libretro core.

PicoDrive is an open-source Sega 8/16 bit and 32X emulator which was written
having ARM-based handheld devices in mind. The critical parts (renderer, 68K
and Z80 cpu interpreters) and some other random code is written in ARM asm,
other code is C.

PicoDrive requires a real BIOS for Sega CD/Mega CD emulation to work.

* bios_CD_E.bin (MegaCD EU BIOS)
* bios_CD_U.bin (SegaCD US BIOS)
* bios_CD_J.bin (MegaCD JP BIOS)
