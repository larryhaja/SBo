Midori is a lightweight, webkit-based web browser.

Features:
    * Full integration with GTK+2
    * Fast rendering with WebKit
    * Tabs, windows and session management
    * Flexibly configurable Web Search.
    * User scripts and user styles support.
    * Straightforward bookmark management.
    * Customizable and extensible interface.
    * Extensions such as Adblock, form history, mouse gestures
      or cookie management.

GTK3 support is disabled by default but can be enabled
by passing GTK3=yes to the script, e.g.

  GTK3=yes ./midori.SlackBuild

If enabled then webkitgtk3 and libunique3 (instead of webkitgtk
and libunique) are required.
