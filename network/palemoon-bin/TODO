pomfland has notified me that:

palemoon could potentially be using some
libraries belonging to seamonkey-solibs. A launcher script might be
necessary:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/palemoon:/opt/palemoon/plugins
> /opt/palemoon/palemoon "$@"

I will look into this when I get a chance, since it seems non-critical.
