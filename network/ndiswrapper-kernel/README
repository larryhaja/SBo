ndiswrapper-kernel (kernel module for NDIS drivers)

Some vendors do not release specifications of the hardware or
providea linux driver for their wireless network cards. This
project provides a linux kernel module that loads and runs NDIS
(Windows network driver API) drivers supplied by the vendors.

If you'd like to build the module for a kernel that isn't currently
running on the system, you should be able to pass that kernel's
"uname -r" output on the command line as the value of KERNEL, as in:
	KERNEL=3.12.2 ./ndiswrapper.SlackBuild
