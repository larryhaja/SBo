gui-ufw (GUI for Uncomplicated Firewall)

A very user-friendly and uncomplicated way to manage ufw.


This version requires that python-distutils-extra be built with python3
support by passing PYTHON3=yes ./python-distutils-extra.SlackBuild when
building.

This version also requires webkit2gtk. If you would rather not have to
build webkit2gtk, you can still use the 12.04.1 version of gui-ufw:
