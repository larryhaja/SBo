dnscrypt-proxy is a tool for securing communications between a client and a DNS
resolver. It provides a local service which can be used directly as your local
resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting and authenticating requests using the
DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server.

By default dnscrypt-proxy is configured to use OpenDNS' servers.
