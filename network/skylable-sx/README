Sx is a reliable, fully distributed cluster solution for your data storage
needs. With Sx you can aggregate the disk space available on multiple servers
and merge it into a single storage system. The cluster makes sure that your data
is always replicated over multiple nodes (the exact number of copies is defined
by the sysadmin) and synchronized.

Additionally Sx has built-in support for deduplication, client-side encryption,
on-the-fly compression and much more.

To start immediately, read /usr/doc/skylable-sx-0.9/quickstart/quickstart.pdf!

NOTE 1: Every required library which is not found on the system will be built
        from the included sources.
        sqlite3 3.8.4.3 can be linked dinamically but you must compile it by
	source (target the lib64 if x86_64 is your system arch).

NOTE 2: To build only a client, uncomment the CLIENT_ONLY parameter in
        skylable-sx.SlackBuild.
