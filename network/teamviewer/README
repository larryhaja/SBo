TeamViewer is a remote control application. TeamViewer provides easy,
fast and secure remote access to Linux, Windows PCs, and Macs.

NOTE: The 64-bit package only works in a multi-lib environment, and it
requires these 32-bit packages: glibc, zlib, freetype, alsa-lib, GConf.

You must give execute permission on /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd and run
/etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd start prior launching TeamViewer application

To make this process repeated on every boot sequence, add this line 
in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd start
fi
