Mozilla Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) is meant for 
organizations that manage their client desktops, including schools,
businesses and other institutions that want to offer Firefox.

Notes:
- This package is not compatible/substitutes Slackware's
  mozilla-firefox package: install only one of the two.

- The package generated from this SlackBuild will be branded
  like an official Mozilla.org Slackware package, so it cannot
  be redistributed.

- This script supports PGO building: it will need double the time
  and disk space to complete but at the end you will have an
  optimized build of firefox. This will work at its best if
  run from the same host that will run the final binary, but
  speed/reactivity will benefit also if run elsewhere.
  To enable it, launch the script with PGO=yes

- To run this SlackBuild you will need ~4 Gb of free disk space
  (~8 Gb for a PGO-enabled build) and if you don't want to hit
  swap during the run you will need 5 Gb of free RAM.
