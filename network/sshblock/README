SSHblock is intended to dynamically and automatically stop SSH-based
dictionary attacks by blocking any IP address that fails an SSH
login too many times too quickly, and automatically unblocks it
after a while.

You may change the pre-defined configuration of SSHblock in
sshblock.pl.tpl (whitelist IP, email, and hostname).
