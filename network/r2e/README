rss2email is a free tool for delivering news from RSS feeds to your
email program.  This allows you to view RSS feeds in an interface you
are already familiar with and to apply filters to incoming feeds.

NOTE:
rss2email has no option for disabling HTTPS certificate verification,
because Python requires this.

But it is possible to monkeypatch the ssl module to disable
verification globally for all feeds.

If you want the verification to be disabled pass CERTVER=no to the
script: CERTVER=no ./r2e.SlackBuild

See README.Slackware for post-installation configuration.
