AjaXplorer Sync is a Dropbox-like desktop sync client for the
cloud file management AjaXplorer. This is the Java Binary.

Please note that the client is in an early state and not supported.
AjaXplorer itself needs to be configured by enabling `meta.filehasher` 
for a repository, which needs the PHP PECL module `rsync` (not available
on SlackBuilds.org) which needs librsync.
