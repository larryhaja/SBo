Dropbox Acceptable Use Policy

   Dropbox is used by millions of people, and we're proud of the trust
   placed in us. In exchange, we trust you to use our services
   responsibly.

   You agree not to misuse the Dropbox services ("Services"). For example,
   you must not, and must not attempt to do the following:
     * probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network;
     * breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication
       measures;
     * access, tamper with, or use non-public areas or parts of the
       Services, or shared areas of the Services you haven't been invited
       to;
     * interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for example
       by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or
       mail-bombing any part of the Services;
     * access or search the Services by any means other than our publicly
       supported interfaces (for example, "scraping");
     * send unsolicited communications, promotions or advertisements, or
       spam;
     * send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information,
       including "spoofing" or "phishing";
     * promote or advertise products or services other than your own
       without appropriate authorization;
     * abuse Dropbox referrals or promotions to get more storage space
       than deserved;
     * abuse the Services in a manner that circumvents their storage space
       limits;
     * sell the Services or Services accounts via unauthorized channels;
     * use automated or other means to create accounts in bulk or to
       access the Services other than by using our official interface
       and/or APIs;
     * publish or share materials that are unlawfully pornographic or
       indecent, or that advocate bigotry, religious, racial or ethnic
       hatred;
     * violate the law in any way including storing, publishing or sharing
       material that's fraudulent, defamatory, misleading, or that
       violates the privacy or infringes the rights of others.
