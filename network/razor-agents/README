Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and
filtering network based on user submissions of spam.  Detection is
done with signatures that efficiently spot mutating spam content and
user input is validated through reputation assignments.
If this package is installed, SpamAssassin performs Razor checks of
e-mail messages.

See http://razor.sourceforge.net/ for more information about Razor.
