tribler (anonymous search engine, video streaming, bittorrent client)

Tribler is a Bittorrent-based video streaming client. You can watch
video files, while you are still downloading them. It relies on VLC
for playback of videos. Tribler also includes fast keyword search and
thumbnail-based navigation. Tribler does not require websites or any
central server to find and watch interesting content.

Without vlc installed, tribler is a fully functional torrent client
and search engine. If you want to stream videos, you will need vlc
installed. This is an optional runtime dependency; you don't need to
rebuild tribler if you decide to install vlc later on.
