qutebrowser (qt5 keyboard driven webbrowser)

qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It's
based on Python and PyQt5 and free software, licensed under the GPL.
It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and
Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

Optional dependency:

qt5-webkit-annulen (for the webkit backend)

NOTE:

pyPEG2 and MarkupSafe both need building for python3:

PYTHON3=yes ./pyPEG2.SlackBuild
PYTHON3=yes ./MarkupSafe.SlackBuild

If you are using sbopkg you can add those as options on their
pages before starting the build queue.

NOTE 2:

There is a list of changes and fixes for versions on the release page:
