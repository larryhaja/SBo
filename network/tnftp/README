`tnftp' is a `port' of the NetBSD FTP client to other systems.

The enhancements over the standard ftp client in 4.4BSD (and
derivatives) include:
  * command-line editing within ftp
  * command-line fetching of URLS, including support for:
      - http proxies (see $http_proxy, $ftp_proxy)
      - authentication
  * configurable prompt
  * context sensitive command and filename completion
  * dynamic progress bar
  * feature negotiation extensions from RFC 2389
    (see `feat' and `remopts')
  * extensions to ftp from the IETF ftpext working group
    (see `mlsd' and `mlst')
  * IPv6 support (from the WIDE project)
  * modification time preservation
  * paging of local and remote files, and of directory listings
    (see `lpage', `page', `pdir')
  * passive mode support, with fallback to active mode
  * retrieval of filenames listed in a given file (see `fget')
  * `set option' override of ftp environment variables
  * TIS Firewall Toolkit gate ftp proxy support (see `gate')
  * transfer-rate throttling (see `-T', `rate')
  * uploading of files on the command line (see `-u')
  * (Dante) SOCKS5 support
