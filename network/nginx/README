nginx [engine x] is a high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy
as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.

By default, nginx will use the "nobody" user and group accounts. You may
specify alternate values on the command line if desired; for example:

    NGINXUSER=backup NGINXGROUP=backup ./nginx.SlackBuild

Regardless of which user and group you decide to use, you will need to make
sure they exist on both the build system and the target system.

Beginning with version 1.4, the SPDY protocol is supported, however it is not 
build by default. If you wish to enable it you need to change USE_SPDY variable:
    
    USE_SPDY=yes ./nginx.SlackBuild
