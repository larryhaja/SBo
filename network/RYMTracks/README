RYMTracks is small helper for all those folks who actively uses and
contributes for RateYourMusic <http://rateyourmusic.com>
Unfortunately `sharifi <http://rateyourmusic.com/~sharifi>`__ still has
this unconvenient track list editor you have to fill by yourself. For
big albums you have to copy/paste every song title and print timestamps
in correct form. Moreover, you even have to put track numbers (just a

it is really painful: you fill all the data feeling yourself like an
idiot. If you feel my pain, this small tool is for you.
