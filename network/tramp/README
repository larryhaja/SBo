After the installation of tramp into your Emacs, you will be able to
access files on remote machines as though they were local.
Access to the remote file system for editing files, version control,
and dired are transparently enabled.
Your access to the remote machine can be with the rsh, rlogin, telnet
programs or with any similar connection method. This connection must
pass ASCII successfully to be usable but need not be 8-bit clean.
The package provides support also for ssh connections out of the box.
