Openfire is a real time collaboration (RTC) server written in Java
and licensed under the Open Source Apache License.
It uses the only widely adopted open protocol for instant messaging,
XMPP (also called Jabber).
Openfire is incredibly easy to setup and administer, but offers
rock-solid security and performance.

See README.Slackware for building and setup details.
