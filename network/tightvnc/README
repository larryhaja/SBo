tightvnc (VNC viewing application)

TightVNC is a free remote control software package. With TightVNC, you can
see the desktop of a remote machine and control it with your local mouse and
keyboard, just like you would do it sitting in the front of that computer.

TightVNC is:

* free for both personal and commercial usage, with full source code available
* useful in administration, tech support, education, and many other purposes
* cross-platform, available for Windows and Unix, with Java client included
* compatible with standard VNC software, conforming to RFB protocol specs

TightVNC also ships with Xvnc, a headless X server that speaks the VNC
protocol.
