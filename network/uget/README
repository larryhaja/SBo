uGet is a Free and Open Source download manager.

It allows for queuing downloads, file type-based classification of
downloads, and is lightweight.

Optionally, uget can be compiled with support for the optional
dependency aria2. This is autodetected at build time. You can
forcibly disable aria2 support by passing ARIA2=no to the script.
