Gophernicus is a modern full-featured (and hopefully) secure gopher
daemon for inetd.

You may want to add this line to your /etc/inetd.conf and then restart
or kill -HUP the inetd process:

gopher  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/in.gophernicus  in.gophernicus -h <your-hostname>

Alternatively, gophernicus can be configured to run under xinetd.
This is done automatically when xinetd is present on the system at
the build time.
