IP2Location C library enables the user to find the country, region,
city, coordinates, zip code, time zone, ISP, domain name, connection
type, area code, weather, MCC, MNC, mobile brand name, elevation and
usage type that any IP address or hostname originates from. It has
been optimized for speed and memory utilization. Developers can use
the API to query all IP2Location binary databases for IPv4 and
IPv6 address.

It contains the IP-COUNTRY BIN databases (IPv4 and IPv6) which
consists of IP address blocks as keys and countries as
values. Developers can download other sample databases to evaluate
other features such as region, city, latitude, longitude, zip code,
ISP, domain name, connection, area code, weather code, mobile network,
elevation, and usage type code using the same C library.

To install the included IP-COUNTRY BIN databases pass DB=yes to
the slackbuild as

   DB=yes ./ip2location-c.SlackBuild
