IP2Location is a C library that enables the user to find the country, region,
city, latitude, longitude, zip code, time zone, ISP, domain name, connection
type, area code, weather, mobile network by IP address or hostname originates
from.  It contains a demo IP2Location IP-COUNTRY BIN database which consists of
real data for IP address range 0.0.0.0 to 99.255.255.255.  This database
contains IP address blocks as key and countries as values.  The paid version of
IP2Location database covers all IP address range. In general, it is more
complete, fast and accurate than using reverse DNS lookups. Developers can
download other sample databases to evaluate other features such as region,
city, latitude, longitude, zip code, ISP, domain name, connection, area code,
weather code and mobile network code using the same C library.
