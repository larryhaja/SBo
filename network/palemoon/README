palemoon (Web browser -- BUILD FROM SOURCE)

This SlackBuild builds Pale Moon from source.
For a binary repackage, see 'palemoon' at SlackBuilds.org.

Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser available for
Microsoft Windows and Linux (with other operating systems in
development), focusing on efficiency and ease of use.

This SlackBuild attempts to compile, build and package Pale Moon,
Slackware style, in a manner that conforms to official Pale Moon Linux
releases; while, at the same time, providing useful and easy ways to
deviate if desired. This SlackBuild may conflict with the alternative
SlackBuild known, here at SBo, as "palemoon"; which repackages binaries
offically released by the Pale Moon devs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To package this version of Pale Moon for installation along side any other
version of Pale Moon, (such as the before mentioned version known here as
"palemoon") pass the script the parameter:

    APPEND_VERSION_SUFFIX=yes

See http://docs.slackware.com/howtos:software:palemoon for additional tips and
help resources.

Using the Oxygen theme is known to cause Pale Moon to crash; if you are
experiencing crashes, and segfaults, make sure you are not using this theme;
or use Alienbob's patched oxygen-gtk2; which will fix this issue.

See the help doc link above for other creative tips and workarounds.

It is recommended that Pale Moon be compiled with gcc 4.9.4. Compiling Pale
Moon with any other compiler may result in an unstable build. Look for
gcclegacy494 here on SBo.

A native fork of FireFox's developer tools exists as an external add-on or
internally. Pale Moon by default ships with the developer tools internally;
if this is undesirable, dev tools can be disabled by passing the script the
parameter:

    DEVTOOLS=no ./palemoon.SlackBuild

Pale Moon's default is to build, ship, and use its own internal dictionary;
if desired, however, do USE_SYSTEM_HUNSPELL=yes ./palemoon.SlackBuild, to
use the Slackware system Hunspell instead. This assumes you have dictionaries
such as hunspell-en or hunspell-es installed in /usr/share/hunspell -- the
location that a few SlackBuilds at SBo install them.

To remove the "AdNauseam" extension from the Pale Moon blocklist, do

    ADNAUSEAM=unblock ./palemoon.SlackBuild

To remove the "NoScript" extension from the Pale Moon blocklist, do

    NOSCRIPT=unblock ./palemoon.SlackBuild

Note: The most up-to-date version of the NoScript campatible with Pale Moon can
be found here: https://noscript.net/getit#classic

If your processor doesn't support sse2 instructions or you get segfaults,
try looking in the SlackBuild for the OPTIMIZE build option (eventually
refer to the Pale Moon developers for help).

To enable debug information, pass the script the parameter

    ENABLE_DEBUG=yes
