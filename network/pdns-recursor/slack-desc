# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pdns-recursor: pdns-recursor (high-performance recursive resolver)
pdns-recursor:
pdns-recursor: PowerDNS consists of two parts: the Authoritative Server
pdns-recursor: and the Recursor. Other nameservers fully combine these functions,
pdns-recursor: PowerDNS offers them separately, but can mix both authoritative and
pdns-recursor: recursive usage seamlessly. The Authoritative Server will answer
pdns-recursor: questions about domains it knows about, but will not go out on the net
pdns-recursor: to resolve queries about other domains. However, it can use a
pdns-recursor: recursing backend to provide that functionality. Depending on your
pdns-recursor: needs, this backend can either be the PowerDNS recursor or an external
pdns-recursor: one.
