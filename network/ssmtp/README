sSMTP, replaces sendmail on workstations that should send their mail via the
departmental mailhub from which they pick up their mail (via pop, imap, rsmtp,
pop_fetch, NFS... or the like).  This program accepts mail and sends it to the
mailhub, optionally replacing the domain in the From: line with a different
one.
