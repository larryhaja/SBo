The broadcom-sta package includes the kernel module 'wl', which contains
a Broadcom-provided proprietary kernel driver known to support the
listed chipsets.

BCM4311  (PCI ID 14e4:4311, 14e4:4312, 14e4:4313)
BCM4312  (PCI ID 14e4:4315)
BCM4313  (PCI ID 14e4:4727)
BCM4321  (PCI ID 14e4:4328, 14e4:4329, 14e4:432a)
BCM4322  (PCI ID 14e4:432b, 14e4:432c, 14e4:432d)
BCM43142 (PCI ID 14e4:4365)
BCM43224 (PCI ID 14e4:4353)
BCM43225 (PCI ID 14e4:4357)
BCM43227 (PCI ID 14e4:4358)

BCM4331  (PCI ID 14e4:4331)
BCM4360  (PCI ID 14e4:43a0)
BCM4352  (PCI ID 14e4:43b1)

Some of these devices are also supported by the free b43 and brcm80211
drivers.  In order to avoid conflicts /etc/modprobe.d/b43_blacklist.conf
disables these drivers.

Read the included LICENSE.txt file (placed in /usr/doc) before using the
proprietary driver.

To build the module for a kernel that isn't currently running on the
system, pass that kernel's "uname -r" output such as:

    KERNEL=4.4.67 ./broadcom-sta.SlackBuild

If you would like to name your interface wlan0 instead of eth1, either
rename the device in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules or build
the package with:

    IFNAME=wlan ./broadcom-sta.SlackBuild
