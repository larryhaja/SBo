Pentadactyl is a free browser add-on for Firefox, designed to make browsing
more efficient and especially more keyboard accessible. Largely inspired by the
Vim text editor, the appearance and finger feel should be familiar to Vim
users.

This package will install Pentadactyl for all users on the system. Users will
be prompted to activate the extension when starting Firefox.

To build the package for a Firefox version different from the installed one,
start the script setting the FIREFOX variable as in
        FIREFOX=33.0.0
