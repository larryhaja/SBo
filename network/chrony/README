Chrony is a pair of programs which are used to maintain the accuracy
of the real time clock on a computer via the NTP protocol.

Chrony can serve as both an NTP client for a single computer and as an NTP
server for other computers.

See http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/ for more details.

Note: Because each installation's configuration will differ, the SlackBuild
script does not build or install configuration files.  See the man pages and
the chrony.txt file installed in /usr/doc/chrony-1.29/ (and the contrib and
examples directory) for relevant configuration information.
