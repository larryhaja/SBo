Etherpad lite is a really-real time collaborative editor spawned
from the Hell fire of Etherpad.
We're reusing the well tested Etherpad easysync library to make it
really realtime.
Etherpad Lite is based on node.js ergo is much lighter and more
stable than the original Etherpad. Our hope is that this will
encourage more users to use and install a realtime collaborative
editor. A smaller, etherpad-lite: manageable and well documented
codebase makes it easier for developers to improve the code and
contribute towards the project.

See README.Slackware for some Slackware notes setup (with things
to do before and after building the package).

abiword (with AbiCommand plugin) is required to import/export pads.
