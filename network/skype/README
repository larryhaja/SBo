Skype is a free Voice Over IP program for Linux, Windows and MacOS.
It allows users to communicate with other Skype users running any of
the supported platforms, as well as receiving and placing calls from
and to normal land lines and mobile phones.

This script repackages the shared tarball provided by Skype, which
has been built dynamically. Static binary support has been removed.
