Nagios is a powerful monitoring system that enables organizations to identify
and resolve IT infrastructure problems before they affect critical business
processes.

Nagios requires a "nagios" user and group; create these before running the
SlackBuild script. Examples:

	# groupadd -g 213 nagios
	# useradd -u 213 -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -g nagios nagios

For some scripts to work, it is necessary to include the 'apache' user in
the nagios group.

For some functions (most notably the "map" function), you need to have X
installed on your server. You do not have to start X though, nagios just
needs some of the libraries and fonts.

This SlackBuild installs the basic nagios system in /var/www/htdocs/
To change the location, set the DOCROOT variable:
	# DOCROOT=/your/docroot/dir ./nagios.SlackBuild

For a useful setup, you will want to have monitoring-plugins installed.

To configure nagios, some knowledge of httpd is required.  Check the included
'README.SLACKWARE' file for some basic setup instructions. The include file
for httpd is installed as /etc/httpd/extra/nagios.conf

Lots of information is available in the included documentation, and even
more can be found on the nagios site and wiki <http://wiki.nagios.org>.
