xombrero (keyboard-centric web browser, formerly xxxterm)

xombrero is a minimalist web browser with sophisticated security
features designed-in, rather than through an add-on after-the-fact.
In particular, it provides both persistent and per-session controls
for scripts and cookies.

In addition to providing a familiar mouse-based interface, it offers a
set of vi-like keyboard commands for power-users.
