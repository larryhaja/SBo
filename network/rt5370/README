This is the Linux device driver for Ralink RT5370 USB ABGN WLAN Card.

This driver implements basic IEEE802.11 infrastructure and ad-hoc mode
with open or shared or WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK authentication method.
NONE, WEP, TKIP and AES encryption.

If you wish to build the package for a kernel different from the running
one, pass its release no. to the script in the KERNEL variable, e.g.
KERNEL=3.4.66 ./rt5370.SlackBuild

Note: it may be necessary to create a blacklist file to avoid conflicts
with stock kernel modules, e.g.

echo "blacklist rt2800usb" > /etc/modprobe.d/rt5370.conf
