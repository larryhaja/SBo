The ownCloud Sync Client is a desktop program you install on your computer.
You specify one or more directories on the local machine to sync with your
ownCloud server, and always have your latest files wherever you are. Make
a change to the files on one computer, it will flow across the others using
the desktop sync clients.

This package optionally requires the Sphinx package in order to create its
man pages.

Note:  As of version 2.3.3, qt4 support was dropped and this package requires
       qt5-webkit. You will also need to build qtkeychain with qt5.

Note:  If you wish to try building this package against qt4 you will need to
       build qtkeychain with qt4, and build this package with BUILD_WITH_QT4
       set to 'yes'. There are no guarantees that this will work.
       For example:

         BUILD_WITH_QT4=yes ./owncloud-client.SlackBuild
