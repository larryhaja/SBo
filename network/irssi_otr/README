irssi_otr (Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) for IRC clients)

Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) plugin for xchat and irssi

To use OTR within irssi, install this package, then "/load libotr"
and "/otr help" for usage instructions. Also see the README in
/usr/doc/irssi_otr-$VERSION. To use with xchat, see also README.xchat.

Note: The xchat plugin is automatically loaded when xchat starts.

Either irssi or xchat support can be disabled by setting one of IRSSI=no
or XCHAT=no in the script's environment. It's an error to disable both.
