Lightweight authoritative Name Server with DNSSEC capabilities. Developed
by the passionate people behind the .eu top-level domain, YADIFA has been
built from scratch to face today's DNS challenges, with no compromise
on security, speed and stability, to offer a better and safer Internet
experience.

Package binaries and shared objects linked here dynamically, but
by-default configure script links it statically, for performance
consideration. Static linking makes sense only on heavy loaded environment
(10+ Mbit DNS traffic, 5000+ queries/second per server).

YADIFA requires its own user in order to run securely. It is not advised
to run services as root user without special reason.

To add yadifa user in system run as root:

# groupadd -g 332 yadifa
# useradd -u 332 -d /var/lib/yadifa -g yadifa -s /bin/false yadifa

In order to run YADIFA during boot process, add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.yadifa ]; then
   /etc/rc.d/rc.yadifa start
fi
