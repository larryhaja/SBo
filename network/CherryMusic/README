CherryMusic is a music streaming server based on CherryPy and jPlayer.
It plays the music inside your PC, smartphone, tablet, toaster or whatever
device has a HTML5 compliant browser installed.

current features:

  - stream your music inside the browser (locally or remote)
  - browse and search your music
  - completely AJAX based (no page reloads on click, therefore fast)
  - create and share playlists
  - multiple user authentication
  - HTTPS support
  - automatic album cover art fetching

Optional dependencies are:

  Live transcoding: lame, vorbis-tools, flac, faad2, mpg123 or ffmpeg (which replaces the abovementioned codecs plus adds WMA decoding)
  ID3-Tag reading: stagger (works only with Python 3)
  Automatic resizing of displayed cover art: imagemagick
  For special character search terms: python-unidecode
  For the GTK system tray icon: python-gobject
  HTTPS support in Python 2: pyOpenSSL (in Python 3 it works out of the box)
