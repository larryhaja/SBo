CherryMusic (music streaming server)

CherryMusic is a music streaming server based on CherryPy and jPlayer.
It can be run remotely or on a single computer and is designed to handle
huge music libraries of 3 TB and more; it also works well with small
collections. In contrast to MPD, Icecast and the like, CherryMusic allows
multiple users to log in via HTTP/HTTPS using a web browser, browse and
search the music database, manage playlists and stream music to the browser.

The CherryMusic server runs on Linux, Windows and OS X, as long as Python
and SQLite are available. To use the web client, any device with a modern 
browser will do.

Optional dependencies are:

    Live transcoding: lame, vorbis-tools, flac, faad2, mpg123, opus-tools
    or ffmpeg (which replaces the aforementioned codecs plus adds WMA
    decoding)

    Automatic resizing of displayed cover art: imagemagick

    For special character search terms: python-unidecode

    For the GTK system tray icon: python-gobject

    HTTPS support in Python 2: pyOpenSSL (in Python 3 it works out of the box)
