# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cmst: cmst (GUI for connman daemon)
cmst:
cmst: The program provides graphical user interface to control the
cmst: connman daemon. The connman daemon must be started
cmst: as you normally would, this program just interfaces with that
cmst: daemon. You can see what technologies and services connman
cmst: has found, and for wifi services an agent is registered to assist
cmst: in obtaining the information from you necessary to logon the
cmst: wifi service.
