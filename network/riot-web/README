riot-web (Riot for Desktop)

Riot gathers all your conversations and app integrations into one single app.

Built around group chatrooms, Riot lets you share messages, images, videos
and files - interact with your tools and access all your different communities
under one roof.

One single identity and place for all your teams: no need to switch accounts,
work and chat with people from different organisations in public or private rooms:
from professional projects to school trips, Riot will become the center of all
your discussions!

Now with end-to-end encryption! You can view and verify your various devices in
the user settings page.

This is a repackaging of the official binary .deb file
