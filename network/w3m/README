w3m is a World Wide Web (WWW) text based client.

Help is avaliable in English, German and Japanese.  There is an
option menu which can be configured for the chosen lanugage.

It will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents containing
links to files residing on the local system, as well as files
residing on remote systems. It can display HTML tables, frames, and
images, and supports tabbed browsing. In addition, it can be used as
a "pager" in much the same manner as "more" or "less".  w3m can
display images in both the framebuffer, incertain consoles, and the X
server.

Supported consoles for image display are urxvt (rxvt-unicode) and
termite (via a patch), including inside screen (untested with tmux).

Optional dependency: compface
