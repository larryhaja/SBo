dovecot (open source IMAP and POP3 server)

Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 email server for Linux/UNIX-like
systems, written with security primarily in mind. Dovecot is an excellent
choice for both small and large installations. It's fast, simple to set
up, requires no special administration and it uses very little memory.

This script builds dovecot with support for SSL. As such, you must
have openssl installed - openssl-solibs is not enough in itself to meet
this requirement.

By default, MySQL database is selected, switch to PostgreSQL with:

  DATABASE=pgsql ./dovecot.SlackBuild

See the documentation in /usr/doc/dovecot-*/ to get started.


Groupnames and Usernames

You must have both 'dovecot' and 'dovenull' users and groups to run this
script, for example:

  groupadd -g 202 dovecot
  useradd -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -u 202 -g 202 dovecot
  groupadd -g 248 dovenull
  useradd -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -u 248 -g 248 dovenull
