README.Slackware
================

This file contains some specific instructions to complete the
installation of zabbix_agentd on Slackware.

0) Before running the SlackBuild script
---------------------------------------

0.1) zabbix group & user

Before running the zabbix_agentd.SlackBuild script, you will need to create
the 'zabbixagent' user and group. The script won't run if these do not
exist.

The suggested UID and GID is 228, but you can change this as needed:

  # groupadd -g 266 zabbixagent
  # useradd -u 266 -g zabbixagent -m zabbixagent

1) Configuring zabbix_agentd
----------------------------

A standard configuration file is installed as /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf

At least the following lines need to be configured:

  Server=<ip_of_your_zabbix_server>
  Hostname=<hostname_of_your_zabbix_agent>

2) Start & Stop scripts for zabbix agent daemon
-----------------------------------------------

2.1) Automatic startup and shutdown

If you want to start zabbix_agentd on system bootup, include these lines in 
your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  # Start zabbix_agentd
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agentd ]; then
    echo "Starting zabbix agent daemon..."
    /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agentd start
  fi

To guarantee a clean shutdown of zabbix_agentd, include this in 
/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

  # Stop zabbix_agentd
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agentd ]; then
    echo "Stopping zabbix agent daemon..."
    /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agentd stop
  fi

2.2) Make /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agentd executable

Additionally, you'll have to set the rc script to be executable just like 
any other Slackware rc script:

  # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agentd

3) Starting zabbix agent daemon
-------------------------------

Now you are ready to start zabbix_agentd by calling the startup script:

  # /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agentd start

You can check the log file (/var/log/zabbix/zabbig_agentd.log) in case of
problems.

Zabbix uses ports 10050 & 10051 to communicate, so make sure these aren't
blocked on your network.
