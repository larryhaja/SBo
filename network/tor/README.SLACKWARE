The tor-tsocks.conf is no longer distributed or installed.
The tor project recommends that tsocks users use torsocks instead.
As of tor-0.2.1.30-2 and later, rc.tor init script has been updated to get rid
of hardcoded values present inside torctl command script. To successfully use
the newer script be sure to check changes to both /etc/rc.d/rc.tor.new and
/etc/tor/torrc.new as some configurations values are now required and no
longer passed on the command line. The original TorProject.org torrc
configuration is always available as /etc/tor/torrc.sample.
