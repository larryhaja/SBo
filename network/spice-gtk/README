A Gtk client and libraries for spice remote desktop servers.
By default the GTK+3 version is built: if you need the GTK+2 one,
pass to the build script the variable GTK=2

usbredir and qemu are optional dependency.

CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY WARNING: as libcacard is now included in qemu,
if you want smartcard support in spice-gtk you should build qemu
first, then build (spice and) this with it installed.
