Hiawatha (A secure and advanced webserver)

Hiawatha is a webserver for Unix and has been built with security
in mind. This resulted in a highly secure webserver, in both code
and features.

Hiawatha supports many web and HTTP features such as
CGI/FastCGI, HTTP authentication, virtual host support, request
pipelining, keep alive connections, URL rewriting and many more.

Notes:

  To use this package the user/group 'hiawatha' are required.
  You can create them with:

  # groupadd -g 259 hiawatha
  # useradd -u 259 -g 259 -c "User for hiawatha" -d / -s /bin/false hiawatha

  By default:

  * Hiawatha's daemon is going to be listening in the network interface 127.0.0.1:80
    and it can write temporary files inside /var/lib/hiawatha

  * The web root directory is /srv/hiawatha with index.html being
    the default start file.
