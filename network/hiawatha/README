Hiawatha (A secure and advanced Web server)

Hiawatha is a Web server for Unix and has been built with security
in mind. This resulted in a highly secure Web server, in both code
and features.

Hiawatha supports many Web and HTTP features such as
CGI/FASTCGI, HTTP authentication, virtual host support, request
pipelining, keep alive connections, URL rewriting and many more.

Notes:

  To use this package the user/group 'hiawatha' are required.
  You can create them with:

  # groupadd -g 259 hiawatha
  # useradd -u 259 -g 259 -c "Hiawatha HTTP Server" -d / \
          -s /bin/false hiawatha

  By default:

  * Hiawatha's daemon is going to be listening in the network interface
    127.0.0.1:80, and it can write temporary files inside
        /var/lib/hiawatha

  * The Web root directory is /var/hiawatha with index.html being
    the default start file.
