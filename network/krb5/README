Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to
provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using
secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is
available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is
available in many commercial products as well.

Note:
We provide 2 RC scripts that you can use for your own usage:
- rc.kadmind: Kerberos KADM5 administration server init script
- rc.krb5kdc: Kerberos V5 KDC init script
