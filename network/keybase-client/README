This is the node client for the keybase.io website. Keybase is a webapplication
based on open source code that lets you connect your GnuPG key to your accounts in
social networks and therefor prove that the owner of said key is the same
person as the owner of the social network accounts.

As explained on the website, Keybase is more than a website. If you're
comfortable working in a terminal, you can install this keybase command line
program. Note that the recommended way to install the keybase client is using
the provided installer which can be installed using npm. This SlackBuild is for
everyone who feels more comfortable installing Slackware packages.
