Glassfish is an open-source application server for the Java EE platform.
Glassfish is the reference implementation of Java EE and as such supports
Enterprise JavaBeans, JPA, JavaServer Faces, JMS, RMI, JavaServer Pages and
servlets.

You must have a "glassfish" user and a "glassfish" group to run this script:
  groupadd -g 263 glassfish
  useradd -u 263 -g glassfish -d /var/lib/glassfish -s /bin/false glassfish

The SlackBuild will use /var/lib/glassfish to store domain and node
configuration files. The default domain1 will be installed to /var/lib but note
that this will be overwritten on upgrade, so it is advised to install any
applications into a differently-named domain.

The rc.glassfish script will operate on the default domain unless another is
specified on the command line.
