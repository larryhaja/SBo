# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

quassel: quassel (A cross platform IRC client)
quassel:
quassel: quassel is based on the qt4 platform.  The quassel core connects to
quassel: servers and the quassel client connects to quassel core over the
quassel: internet.  It means you can retain your IRC sessions even if your
quassel: X session is blowed up.  Multiple clients can attach to and detach
quassel: from a central core.  It's like a combination of GNU screen with
quassel: such console IRC clients as weechat, bitchX, and irssi.
