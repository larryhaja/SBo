quassel (A cross platform IRC client)

quassel is based on the qt4 platform.  The quassel core connects to
servers and the quassel client connects to quassel core over the 
internet.  It means you can retain your IRC sessions even if your 
X session is blowed up.  Multiple clients can attach to and detach 
from a central core.  It's like a combination of GNU screen with 
such console IRC clients as weechat, bitchX, and irssi.
