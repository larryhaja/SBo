Nexus manages software artifacts required for development, deployment, and 
provisioning. If you develop software, Nexus can help you share those
artifacts with other developers and end-users.

Nexus requires a "nexus" user and group; create these before running the
SlackBuild script. Examples:

# groupadd -g 252 nexus
# useradd -u 252 -s /bin/sh -d /dev/null -g nexus nexus

Should I Use 3.0 Or 2.x?
We are advising that you use Nexus Repository 3.0 if you are planning to use npm, Bower, NuGet or Docker.
If you are using Maven, we suggest that you continue to use Nexus Repository 2.x as we are still building
features for 3.0 that many Maven folks will find handy.
