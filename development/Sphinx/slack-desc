# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

Sphinx: Sphinx (Documentation generator)
Sphinx:
Sphinx: Sphinx is a tool that translates a set of reStructuredText source
Sphinx: files into various output formats, automatically producing
Sphinx: cross-references, indices etc.  The focus is on hand-written
Sphinx: documentation, rather than auto-generated API docs.  Though there is
Sphinx: support for that kind of docs as well (which is intended to be
Sphinx: freely mixed with hand-written content).  If you need pure API docs
Sphinx: have a look at Epydoc, which also understands reST.
