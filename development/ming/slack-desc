# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ming: Ming is a Flash (SWF) output library. It can be used from PHP,
ming: Perl, Ruby, Python, C, C++, Java, and probably more on the way.
ming: It comprises a lot of Flash functionality, including features
ming: of Flash 6. Specifically, it lets you create: shapes (including
ming: morphs), text, sprites (aka movie clips), buttons, and actions
ming: in flash movies, plus more. The goal for Ming is to abstract
ming: away all of the mundane specifics of the SWF file format.
