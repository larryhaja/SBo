Android Studio is a new Android development environment based
on IntelliJ IDEA. It provides new features and improvements over
Eclipse ADT and will be the official Android IDE once it's
ready.
On top of the capabilities you expect from IntelliJ,
Android Studio offers:

 - Flexible Gradle-based build system.
 - Build variants and multiple APK generation.
 - Expanded template support for Google Services and various
   device types.
 - Rich layout editor with support for theme editing.
 - Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version
   compatibility, and other problems.
 - ProGuard and app-signing capabilities.
 - Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, making it easy
   to integrate Google Cloud Messaging and App Engine.

After having installed this package, run Android Studio with:
  android-studio

# General tips
- google-droid-fonts package may give you font issues with IntelliJ
  based applications (like Android Studio), and removing it should
  suffice to fix the issues.
- An embedded version of JDK is included in this package for
  Android Studio, which is needed to use it effectively.
  However, I suggest to install an independent version (available in
  slackbuilds.org).
  If you already have JDK installed, you may want to specify it under
  File → Project Structure → SDK Location
  - Uncheck "Use embedded JDK", and
  - set the right path (likely /usr/lib/java).

# No multilib systems
Android Studio "requires" a multilib system. It is however possible
to use PART of its functionality with a 32-bit Slackware or a
64-bit non-multilib Slackware64.

## Slackware (32-bit) tips.
- An embedded version of JDK is included in this package for
  Android Studio. However, it does not work in 32 bit Slackware
  and, therefore, jdk is required (available in SlackBuild.org).
- You unlikely can use adb.
- A downgrade of some tools is required to create APKs:
  - Gradle 3.2                 (File → Project Structure → Project)
  - Android plugin 2.2.2       (File → Project Structure → Project)
  - Build Tools Version 23.0.3 (File → Project Structure → app under Modules)

## Slackware64 tips.
You will experience some problems installing the Android SDK (as it uses
some 32-bit binaries) and running 32-bit AVDs.
