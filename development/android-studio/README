Android Studio is a new Android development environment based 
on IntelliJ IDEA. It provides new features and improvements over 
Eclipse ADT and will be the official Android IDE once it's 
ready. 
On top of the capabilities you expect from IntelliJ, 
Android Studio offers:

 - Flexible Gradle-based build system.
 - Build variants and multiple APK generation.
 - Expanded template support for Google Services and various 
   device types.
 - Rich layout editor with support for theme editing.
 - Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version 
   compatibility, and other problems.
 - ProGuard and app-signing capabilities.
 - Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, making it easy 
   to integrate Google Cloud Messaging and App Engine.
   
After having installed this package, run Android Studio with:
  android-studio
  
The application would ask you for Java JDK, which is needed to 
use it effectively; if you have JavaJDK installed it could be 
in /usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}/java
