OpenDBX is an extremely lightweight but extensible database access
library written in C. It provides an abstraction layer to all supported
databases with a single, clean and simple interface that leads to an
elegant code design automatically. If you want your application to
support different databases with little effort, this is definitively
the right thing for you!
