Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the
largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

NOTE
This is the LTS version of nodejs 6 (Boron) which will be maintained
up to April 2019 or until all scripts have been known to work with
nodejs LTS 8.x (Carbon).
