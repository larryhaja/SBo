asl (portable macro cross assembler)

ASL is a portable macro cross assembler for a variety of microprocessors
and microcontrollers. Though it is mainly targeted at embedded processors
and single-board computers, there are also CPU families in the target
list that are used in workstations and PCs. For a full list of targets,
see: http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/as_EN.html#sect_1_2_

Note: The source downloaded is a snapshot. There hasn't been an ASL
release since 1999, although development snapshots are still released
every month or so.

Build options:

UTF8=yes - Set this in the environment if you want ASL to use UTF-8 for
its log and error messages. By default, ISO-8859-1 is used.

TESTS=no - Don't run ASL's test suite. This should only be used on slow
systems to save building time.

DOCTYPES - ASL's documentation can be installed as HTML, PDF, PostScript,
and/or plain text. DOCTYPES is a space-separated list of formats, which
may include any of: html pdf ps txt. The default is "html". If you plan
to print a copy of the docs, you might want e.g. DOCTYPES="html pdf".
All formats are installed to /usr/doc/asl-$VERSION/, as usual.
