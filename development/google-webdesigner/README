Google Web Designer is an advanced web application built with HTML5
which lets you design and build HTML5 advertisements and other web
content using an integrated visual and code interface.

Google Web Designer requires an internet connection to run
the first time after installation.

Note:
Google updates the package without changing the download
link location and they don't use version numbering in the filename
(the version is more an internal numbering).

Therefore, this script is subject to failing (and a different MD5SUM)
at any time due to the fact that you might get a newer version
of Google Web Designer than what the script is designed to use.
Please notify the maintainer if this is the case.
