This is Rakudo Perl, a Perl 6 compiler for the Parrot virtual machine.

This directory contains only the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler itself; it 
does not contain any of the modules, documentation, or other items
that would normally come with a full Perl 6 distribution.  If you're
after more than just the bare compiler, please download the latest
Rakudo Star package.
