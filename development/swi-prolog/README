SWI-Prolog is a comprehensive Prolog environment. Its development
started in 1987 and has been driven by real-world applications.
SWI-Prolog is widely used in research, education, and commercial
applications.

swi-prolog is build without BerkeleyDB support at the moment
(too experimental and won't build) and without GMP support.
If you want GMP support with swiprolog run the script with
  GMP=yes ./swi-prolog.SlackBuild
