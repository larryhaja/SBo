OpenJDK is an open source implementation of the Java(TM) 2 Platform
Standard Edition Development Kit. This package is built with the
IcedTea build and integration project and is thus free software.
It includes tools for developing, testing, and running programs
written in the Java programming language.

apache-ant is a required dependency and you have to install it before
you build openjdk. However, you do not need to install Oracle's jdk,
since it's only a runtime dependency.

This script imports the security certificates also found in Oracle's
jdk. You can override this behavior by invoking the script like this:

KEYSTORE_NO_IMPORT=YES ./openjdk.SlackBuild

The above line, however, will cause some programs to fail to estab-
lish secure connections.

Before installing this package please consider any other jdk's/jre's
that you have already installed as they may cause conflicts with the
PATH, JAVA_HOME and MANPATH variables.

After installing the package you will need to logout/reboot your machine
as it will add new files to the /etc/profile.d folder.

This script may take a couple of hours to finish and will require
about 11 GB of disk space for its temporary directory. It defaults to
"/tmp/SBo" and you may redefine it by invoking the script like this:

TMP=/your/temporary/dir ./openjdk.SlackBuild
