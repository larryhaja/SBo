Eclipse - An open-source, platform-independent software framework.

Eclipse is an open source community whose projects are focused on building an 
open development platform comprised of extensible frameworks, tools, and 
runtimes for building, deploying, and managing software across the lifecycle.

The classic Eclipse package contains: the Eclipse Platform, Java Development 
Tools, and Plug-in Development Environment, including source and both user 
and programmer documentation. 

Upgrading: if you find an error during Eclipse initialization, check 
this two files: 

/opt/eclipse/configuration/config.ini
/opt/eclipse/eclipse.ini

If you haven't done modifications in those files, overwrite them with 
config.ini.new and eclipse.ini.new.
