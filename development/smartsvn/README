SmartSvn is a commercial desktop svn client that provides trial edition for
a limited time (31 days)

Automatically downloading the url included in the .info file may not work as 
they currently require that you submit contact info to be emailed a link to
the download. I've kept the access token in the file in hopes that it continues
to work.
