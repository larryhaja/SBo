GNUstep is a free, object-oriented, cross-platform development environment
that strives for simplicity and elegance.  GNUstep is based on and completely
compatible with the OpenStep specification developed by NeXT (now Apple
Computer Inc.) as well as implementing the extensions added by Apple in the
form of Cocoa.

The GNUstep Startup package combines all four core packages (Make, Base,
GUI and Backend), plus ffcall.

This is the message after compiling from source, because the files 
are then put in a package you will miss it:

Installation Finished

---------------------------------------------------------

Now run the GNUstep initialization script (put this in your
.bashrc or other type of startup script). Note the '.' at the
beginning of the line.
. /opt/gnustep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

Now you can install some applications and start using GNUstep
Look for a few applications in the AppSources directory. The
typical way to install an application is:
  tar -zxf MyApplication.tar.gz
  cd MyApplication
  make
  make install (as root, unless GNUstep is in your home dir)

Then start the application:
  openapp MyApplication.app
