shtags.pl is a script to generate tag files for shell and perl scripts.

USAGE: shtags.pl [-kvwVx] [-t <file>] <files>
    -t <file>   Name of tags file to create. (default is 'tags')
    -s <shell>  Name of the shell language in the script
    -v          Include variable definitions.
                (variables mentioned at the start of a line)
    -V          Print version information.
    -w          Suppress "duplicate tag" warnings.
    -x          Explicitly create a new tags file. Normally tags are merged.
    <files>     List of files to scan for tags.

This is an update to the one that comes with vim, modified to use Getopt::Std
rather than the older getopts.pl that came with perl4.

Supported script types:

sh     Bourne Shell (including bash, but use -s sh)
perl   Perl (versions 4 and 5)
ksh    Korn Shell
tclsh  The TCL shell
wish   The TK Windowing shell (same as tclsh)

See man (1) shtags for more information.
