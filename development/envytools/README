The nva, hwtest and vdpow tools are built by default, but can be disabled,
for example

  NVA="no" HWTEST="no" VDPOW="no" ./envytools.SlackBuild

Note that if the nva tool is disabled, the hwtest and vdpow tools will
also be disabled.

Optional dependencies (see above): cudatoolkit, libseccomp, and python3
