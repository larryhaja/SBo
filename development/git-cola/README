git-cola is a sleek and powerful graphical user interface for Git.
git-cola is free software and written in Python (v2 + v3).

git-cola uses QtPy (included), so you can choose between PyQt4, PyQt5,
and PySide by setting the QT_API environment variable to pyqt4, pyqt5 or
pyside as desired. qtpy defaults to pyqt5 and falls back to pyqt4 if
pyqt5 is not installed.

Set QT_API=pyqt4 in your environment if you have both versions of PyQt
installed and want to ensure that PyQt4 is used.

PyQt5 is an optional dependency if you want a more "modern" interface.
pyside is an optional, untested, dependency.
