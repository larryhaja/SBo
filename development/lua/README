Lua is a free software light-weight programming language designed
for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
general-purpose, stand-alone scripting language.

This package is for the version 5.1.x of lua, the one compatible
with the software that needs lua on slackbuilds.org.
There is also lua52, providing lua 5.2.x, but it's not parallel
installable and it's still not compatible with anything here.
If in doubt, choose this version (lua, *NOT* lua52).
