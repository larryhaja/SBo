IPython is a replacement shell for Python programming. It offers:

* An enhanced Python shell for the terminal
* A Qt-based console
* A web-based notebook for coding
* An architecture for interactive parallel computing 

matplotlib, pyzmq and tornado are all strongly-recommended dependencies.
Without these, only IPython's default console will run.
