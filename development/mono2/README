Mono is a software platform designed to allow developers to easily create 
cross platform applications.  It is an open source implementation of 
Microsoft's .Net Framework based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common 
Language Runtime.  We feel that by embracing a successful, standardized 
software platform, we can lower the barriers to producing great applications 
for Linux.

This is a legacy version of mono, the last stable release of 
the 2.10.x series. 
Certain programs are known to run well with this older version 
(such as opensim). You should try to run your program under the newer 
version on slackbuilds.org simply called 'mono' if you are unsure what 
version is required.

THIS VERSION WILL CONFLICT WITH THE NEWER VERSION OF MONO.

The executable is 'mono2'.
