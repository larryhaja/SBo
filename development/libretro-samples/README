A set of samples to illustrate the libretro API.

The Vulkan sample cores can be optionally installed. This will require both a
video card and driver that support Vulkan, but Slackware does not yet provide
any Vulkan support, so providing the correct build environment is up to you.
To build with Vulkan use:
  VULKAN=1 ./libretro-samples.SlackBuild

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./libretro-samples.SlackBuild

fpc is an optional dependency for the pascal_pong_libretro core.
