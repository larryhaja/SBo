Code::Blocks is a free C++ IDE built to meet the most demanding needs of its
users.  It is designed to be very extensible and fully configurable.
Built around a plugin framework, Code::Blocks can be extended with plugins.
Any kind of functionality can be added by installing/coding a plugin.

N.B. Path for codeblocks plugins is now /usr/lib{,64}/codeblocks/plugins.
Take care if upgrading from a previous version and you have already
installed additional plugins (you might need to reinstall them).
