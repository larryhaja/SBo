# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nqp: NQP (Not Quite Perl)
nqp:
nqp: This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a lightweight Perl 6-like environment
nqp: for virtual machines.  The key feature of NQP is that it's
nqp: designed to be a very small environment (as compared with, say, perl6
nqp: or Rakudo) and is focused on being a high-level way to create
nqp: compilers and libraries for virtual machines (such as the Parrot
nqp: Virtual Machine).  Unlike a full-fledged implementation of Perl 6,
nqp: NQP strives to have as small a runtime footprint as it can, while
nqp: still providing a Perl 6 object model and regular expression engine
nqp: for the virtual machine.
