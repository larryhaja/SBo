Ebe IDE

This is for Assembly and C/C++ as well as Fortran.
It has has a "Toy Box" to help anyone with learning a little of 
C++ and Fortran. And is designed for learning Assembly language.

There are a few non-critical bugs at the moment that the author is aware of
and working on. I believe the windows executable has been updated already,
so it might not be too long.

Also if launching this through Fluxbox's menu you may encounter a warning
message concerning gdb when you run a program in the terminal.
You can ignore this message, and it has a gdb console.
