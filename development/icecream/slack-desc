# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

icecream: icecream (network-distributed compilation)
icecream:
icecream: Icecream is a distributed compile system. It allows parallel
icecream: compiling by distributing the compile jobs to several nodes of a
icecream: compile network running the statistics information to the icecc
icecream: monitor. Each compile node can accept one or more compile jobs
icecream: depending on the number of processors and the settings of icecc
icecream: daemon. The icecc scheduler routes the jobs and provides status
icecream: and the daemon. Link jobs and other jobs which cannot be
icecream: distributed are executed locally on the node where the compilation
icecream: is started.
