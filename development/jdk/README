This is a SlackBuild that will repackage Oracle Java into a package that
can be easily installed, upgraded, or removed using Slackware's native
package management tools.

This will also package JRE so you will not need a separate JRE build.

You must Agree to Oracle's download agreement before this can be downloaded.
This means you have to use a web browser to download it. Sorry wget folks.

The mozilla plugin is no longer activated by default.
