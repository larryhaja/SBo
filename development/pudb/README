PuDB is a full-screen, console-based visual debugger for Python.

Its goal is to provide all the niceties of modern GUI-based debuggers in a
more lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. PuDB allows you to debug
code right where you write and test it--in a terminal. If you've worked
with the excellent (but nowadays ancient) DOS-based Turbo Pascal or C
tools, PuDB's UI might look familiar.

By default this SlackBuild builds the python2 debugger, and if python3 is
detected, the python3 version too. The Pygments SlackBuild will automatically
install for python3 too.

NOTE: The python3 application is named pudb3.
NOTE: You need python3-urwid installed to use pudb3.

OPTIONS

To *ONLY* build the python2 version, use:

NO_PYTHON3=1 ./pudb.SlackBuild

To *ONLY* build the python3 version, use:

NO_PYTHON2=1 ./pudb.SlackBuild

The python2 version requires a newer version of urwid than the stock Slackware
one, therefore this also builds a custom urwid named py2_urwid, which it can
use. This should not conflict with the stock Slackware version.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES

python3-urwid for the python3 version. Note that it will still build without
this, so it can be installed later if needed.
