Qt Creator 3 is a Cross-Platform Qt IDE.

The goal of Qt Creator is to provide a cross-platform, complete 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop Qt projects.

NOTES:
1 - This package conflicts with qt-creator (version 2): install 
    only one of the two.

2 - This version of Qt Creator is advised for Qt5.

3 - Before start building/editing your application, you should 
    configure the Qt kits (both Qt4 and Qt5).

4 - QmlDesigner will work properly only if you configure the Qt5
    Kit properly (Tools->Options->Build & Run->Kits) and make
    it the Default Kit.

5 - An old IDE configuration in user home directory 
    (.config/QtProject*) also can lead to strange behavior.
