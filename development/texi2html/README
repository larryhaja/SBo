texi2html converts texinfo documents to HTML, Info, docbook, and XML.

This conflicts with the tetex package shipped with Slackware, as
an older texi2html comes with it.  However, if you plan to replace
tetex with texlive, you will need a standalone installation of 
texi2html, so this is intended to serve that purpose.
