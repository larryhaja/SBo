Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language written 
in Java. Jython programs can use any Java class, and includes almost
all modules in standard Python.

Jython is able to compile Python source code down to Java bytecodes 
which can then run directly on a JVM; it also includes a set of 
libraries which are used by the compiled Java bytecodes and extra 
support to make it easy to use Java packages from within Jython.
