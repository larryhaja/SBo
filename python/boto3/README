Boto is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for
Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use
of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. You can find the latest, most
up to date, documentation at `Read the Docs`_, including a list of
services that are supported.

**WARNING**: Boto 3 is in *developer preview* and **should not** be used in
production yet! Please try it out and give feedback by opening issues or
pull requests on this repository.

Note: boto3 can be installed alongside boto.

Optional dependencies: pysetuptools
