Boto is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services.

The goal of boto is to support the full breadth and depth of Amazon Web
Services. In addition, boto provides support for other public services such as
Google Storage in addition to private cloud systems like Eucalyptus, OpenStack
and Open Nebula.

Optional dependencies: simplejson, filechunkio, lxml and keyring (this last
isn't yet available on SlackBuilds.org).
