PySDL2 is a wrapper around the SDL2 library and as such similar to
the discontinued PySDL project. In contrast to PySDL, it has no
licensing restrictions, nor does it rely on C code, but uses ctypes
instead.

Optional dependencies : SDL2_image SDL2_mixer SDL2_ttf SDL2_gfx
those are optional though and only necessary, if you want to use.
