Simplejson is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible JSON
<http://json.org> encoder and decoder for Python 2.5+ and Python 3.3+. It is
pure Python code with no dependencies, but includes an optional C extension for
a serious speed boost.

Optional documentation can be built if Sphinx and Pygments are installed.
