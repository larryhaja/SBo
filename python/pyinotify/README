Pyinotify is a Python module for monitoring filesystems changes.
Pyinotify relies on a Linux Kernel feature (merged in kernel 2.6.13)
called inotify. inotify is an event-driven notifier, its notifications
are exported from kernel space to user space through three system calls.

pysetuptools and python3 are optional deps that will be used if present.
