phply is a parser for the PHP programming language written using PLY, a
Lex/YACC-style parser generator toolkit for Python.

See README.Slackware for some usage notes.

A Note on Dependencies:

Nose is only required to run the python test suite.  It is not a
run-time dependency and can be safely removed after phply is built.

The python library simplejson is an optional dependency.  phply ships with a
script php2json.py in /usr/doc/phply-$VERSION/tools that requires it.
