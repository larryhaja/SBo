sh (previously pbs) is a full-fledged subprocess interface for Python that
allows you to call any program as if it were a function.

Eg:
from sh import ifconfig
print(ifconfig("wlan0"))

Optional dependency: python3

Note: Pass PYTHON3=yes to the slackbuild for pyhton 3 support.

  # PYTHON3="yes" ./python-sh.SlackBuild
