Python/JavaScript bridge module, making use of Mozilla's spidermonkey
JavaScript implementation.  Allows implementation of JavaScript classes,
objects and functions in Python, and evaluation and calling of JavaScript
scripts and functions respectively.  Borrows heavily from Claes Jacobssen's
Javascript Perl module, in turn based on Mozilla's 'PerlConnect' Perl binding.

Code is taken from the mozjs185-port branch of
https://github.com/garywiz/python-spidermonkey
