The Python X library is intended to be a fully functional X client for Python
programs. It is written entirely in Python, in ontrast to earlier X libraries
for Python. This is possible to do since X client programs communicate with
the X server via the X protocol. The communication takes over TCP/IP, Unix
sockets, or any other streaming network protocol.
