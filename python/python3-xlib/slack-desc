# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-xlib: python3-xlib (X Library module for Python3)
python3-xlib:
python3-xlib: The Python X library is intended to be a fully functional X
python3-xlib: client for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in
python3-xlib: contrast to earlier X libraries for Python. This is possible to
python3-xlib: do since X client programs communicate with the X server via the
python3-xlib: X protocol. The communication takes over TCP/IP, Unix sockets, or
python3-xlib: any other streaming network protocol.
