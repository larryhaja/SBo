dfvfs (Digital Forensics Virtual File System - python module)

This package provides read-only access to file-system objects from various 
storage media types and file formats. The goal of dfVFS is to provide a generic
interface for accessing file-system objects, for which it uses several 
back-ends that provide the actual implementation of the various storage media 
types, volume systems and file systems.
