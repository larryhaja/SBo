# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-future: python-future (Python 2/3 compatibility)
python-future:
python-future: python-future is the missing compatibility layer between Python 2 and
python-future: Python 3. It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible
python-future: codebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead.
