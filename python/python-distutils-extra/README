Python-distutils-extra allows to easily integrate themable icons, 
scrollkeeper based documentation, and gettext based translations in 
your python install and build tools.  It can be used with python's 
distutils or the enhanced setuptools.  

To install python3 bindings run the slackbuild with PYTHON3=yes.

  # PYTHON3=yes ./python-distutils-extra.SlackBuild
