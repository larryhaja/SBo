# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-transformers: haskell-transformers (Concrete functor and monad transformers)
haskell-transformers:
haskell-transformers: This part contains the monad transformer class, the concrete monad
haskell-transformers: transformers, operations and liftings.  It can be used on its own in
haskell-transformers: Haskell 98 code, or with the monad classes in the monads-fd or
haskell-transformers: monads-tf packages, which automatically lift operations introduced
haskell-transformers: by monad transformers through other transformers.
