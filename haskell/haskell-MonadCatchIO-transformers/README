Provides functions to throw and catch exceptions. Unlike the
functions from Control.Exception, which work in IO, these work in
any stack of monad transformers (from the transformers package) with
IO as the base monad. You can extend this functionality to other
monads, by creating an instance of the MonadCatchIO class. Warning:
this package is deprecated. Use the exceptions package instead, if
possible.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
