# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers: haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers (functions to deal with exceptions)
haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers:
haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers: Provides functions to throw and catch exceptions. Unlike the
haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers: functions from Control.Exception, which work in IO, these work in
haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers: any stack of monad transformers (from the transformers package) with
haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers: IO as the base monad. You can extend this functionality to other
haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers: monads, by creating an instance of the MonadCatchIO class. Warning:
haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers: this package is deprecated. Use the exceptions package instead, if
haskell-MonadCatchIO-transformers: possible.
