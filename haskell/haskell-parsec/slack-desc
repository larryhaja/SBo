# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-parsec: haskell-parsec (Monadic parser combinators for Haskell)
haskell-parsec:
haskell-parsec: Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
haskell-parsec: library.  It is simple, safe, well documented, has extensive
haskell-parsec: libraries and good error messages, and is also fast.  It is defined
haskell-parsec: as a monad transformer that can be stacked on arbitrary monads, and
haskell-parsec: it is also parametric in the input stream type.
