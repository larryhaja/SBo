# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-haskeline: haskell-haskeline (A command-line interface for user input)
haskell-haskeline:
haskell-haskeline: Haskeline provides a user interface for line input in command-line
haskell-haskeline: programs.  This library is similar in purpose to readline, but since
haskell-haskeline: it is written in Haskell it is (hopefully) more easily used in other
haskell-haskeline: Haskell programs.
