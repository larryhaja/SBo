GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive environment
for the functional language Haskell.  This is a complete build, including
interactive system and profiling libraries and documentation.

You will need 4.3G of free space in /tmp/SBo to build this package.

In theory, if you already have ghc 7.4 or newer on your build host,
you can skip the bootstrapping done by this script by passing
BOOTSTRAP=no environment variable to this script.  In that case, you
also do not have to download the bindist, just the ghc-*-src.tar.xz.
This is not recommended, though, since it is poorly tested.
