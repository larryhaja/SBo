Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X
for Linux and Unix.

NOTE: This builds the stable version of wine. If you need
cutting-edge then you may want to check out wine-staging.

Options:

With no options this SlackBuild will build the 32bit wine package,
for which you need to have multilib installed (see below).

To build a package for both 64bit and 32bit Windows executable
support, use:

WIN64=yes ./wine.SlackBuild

To disable win32 support, use:

NOWIN32=yes ./wine.SlackBuild

Or combine them both to build only a 64bit wine package.

To disable OpenGL support, use:

OPENGL=no ./wine.SlackBuild

The above options can be combined.

Optional dependencies:

fontforge:
(to build tahoma, tahomabd, and marlett fonts)

webcore-fonts:
(for tahoma, lucida console, MS fonts for the web and Win Vista)

====================================================================

NOTES

With 64bit support you would use the wine64 binary. If you have a
combined 32 and 64bit package you need to set the environmental
variable WINEPREFIX to point to the 64bit wine directory when running
wine64, which should be different to the 32bit directory (~/.wine by
default). Example:

WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64 wine64 notepad

To build the 32bit wine on x86_64 you will need to have multilib
packages installed, unless you want to build for Windows 64 bit
applications only (using WIN64=yes NOWIN32=yes).

AlienBOB's multilib readme and repo:

I have made a script that rsyncs with alienBOB's repo and installs
the multilib packages which can be found here:

Be sure to read the short instructions at the top. If you use
slackpkg then you will also want to blacklist his packages in
/etc/slackpkg/blacklist:

[0-9]+alien
[0-9]+compat32
