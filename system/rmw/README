rmw is an OS portable cli trash can utility written in C. It can send
files to your "Desktop" trash, or a completely separate folder. It can
also: restore files; permanently delete files that were rmw'ed more
than xx number of days ago; skip files or directories that have a
"PROTECT" directive in the configuration file; and append a unique
string to the filenames so they won't be overwritten (duplication
protection).
