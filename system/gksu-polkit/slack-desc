# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gksu-polkit:
gksu-polkit: gksu is a library and application used to ask the user for passwords
gksu-polkit: to run programs as root. It is not a good option now that we have
gksu-polkit: PolicyKit. This new version will provide similar functionality to
gksu-polkit: cover applications which still haven't been patched to use PolicyKit.
