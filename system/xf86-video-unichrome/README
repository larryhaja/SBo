xf86-video-unichrome (driver for various VIA gpus)

The Unichrome Project provides Free and Open Source support for the
S3 Unichrome family of integrated graphics devices, as found on all
recent VIA Technologies Northbridges.

NOTICE:
The source tarball is created of a git clone I did myself. If you want to
get the sources by yourself, they can be aquired like this:

git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/~libv/xf86-video-unichrome/

Configuration:
You'll find a 10-unichrome.conf in /usr/doc/xf86-video-unichrome, that
can be moved to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d (or used as xorg.conf..).

Troubleshooting:
Via chips seem to be problematic. Maybe some of this helps:
- disable console vesa modes, use plain vga;
- blacklist framebuffer modules.
