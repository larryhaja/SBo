# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

diit: diit (Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit)
diit:
diit: Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit is a Java steganography tool that can
diit: hide any sort of file inside a digital image (regarding that the
diit: message will fit, and the image is 24 bit colour). There are four
diit: highly customisable algorithms in the tool, as well as an open-source
diit: implementation of RS Analysis (an extremely good steganalysis method).
diit: The tool has the additional advantage of being able to simulate hiding
diit: - so you can get an accurate map of where the information is hidden.
