slack acts like a package manager for your local copy of slackbuilds.
(usually obtained from slackbuilds.org)

It supports following functions/options:

1)  search the repository (-s)
2)  info about specified package (-i)
3)  readme about specified package (-r)
4)  goto the package directory (-g)
5)  view slackbuild (-v)
6)  list files contained in specified package directory (-l)
7)  description about specified package (-d)
8)  get/download the package (-G)
9)  build the package (-B)
10) install the built package (-I)
11) upgrade installed package with built package (-U)
12) remove installed package (-R)
13) query installed packages (-q)
14) view all packages installed from the slackbuilds repo (-a)
15) update git repo of slackbuilds (-u)

Usage:
slack <option> [package]

The variables used in the script, which you would probably
adjust according to your wish, are:

1) repodir=""
 # Repository for slackbuilds.

2) srcpath=""
 # Where the downloaded source packages are to be placed.
 # Leave it blank for saving it in the same directory as the slackbuild.

3) outdir=""
 # Where the build package will be placed. 
 # Leave it blank for putting it in /tmp.

4) gitdir=""
 # Directory where the slackbuilds git repository is present.

These variables can also be configured via editing /etc/slack/slack.conf
