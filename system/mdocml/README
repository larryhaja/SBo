mdocml is a suite of tools compiling mdoc, the roff macro package of choice for
BSD manual pages, and man, the predominant historical package for UNIX manuals.
It is small, ISO C, ISC-licensed, and quite fast.

The tool set features mandoc, based on the libmandoc validating compiler, to
format output for UNIX terminals (with support for wide-character locales),
XHTML, HTML, PostScript, and PDF. It also includes preconv, for recoding
multibyte manuals; demandoc, for emitting only text parts of manuals; mandocdb,
for indexing manuals; and apropos, whatis, and man.cgi (via catman) for
semantic search of manual content.
