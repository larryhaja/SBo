man-pages-fr (french system documentation)

French translation files for the man pages. This build includes both
"man-pages-fr" and "man-pages-extra-fr".

By default, the man pages are converted to ISO-8859-1 (aka Latin-1)
encoding, which works well with LANG=fr_FR. If you're using a UTF-8
locale, and the pages don't display accented characters properly,
try rebuilding the package with UTF8=yes set in the environment, and
possibly also install man-db.
