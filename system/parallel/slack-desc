# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

parallel: parallel (Executes jobs in parallel)
parallel:
parallel: GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one
parallel: or more computers. A job can be a single command or a small script
parallel: that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The typical
parallel: input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a list of
parallel: URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that reads
parallel: from a pipe. GNU parallel can then split the input and pipe it into
parallel: commands in parallel.
