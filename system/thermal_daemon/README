The Linux Thermal Daemon program from 01.org

Thermald deals with thermal issues for intel processor families codenamed 
intel sandy-bridge and above.
Its is a Linux daemon used to prevent the overheating of systems.
This daemon monitors temperature and applies compensation using available 
cooling methods.

Prerequisites:

Uses intel p-state driver and works with kernels 3.10 and above.

Prefers kernel with
  Intel RAPL power capping driver : Available from Linux kernel 3.13.rc1
  Intel P State driver (Available in Linux kernel stable release)
  Intel Power clamp driver (Available in Linux kernel stable release)

  CONFIG_X86_MSR, so that x86 MSR can be read/write from user space
  to control RAPL if no RAPL powecap class driver is not present.

  Default
  If none of the above is available uses cpufreq to control P states.
