Since this is a daemon, it should be started at boot via /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
/usr/bin/thermald

Also it would need to be stopped before shutdown, so an entry could be added
to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown as well:
killall thermald

CONFIG_X86_MSR is listed as an (optional) dependency, msr-tools
can be installed from https://01.org/msr-tools
