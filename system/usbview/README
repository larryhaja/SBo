USBView is a GTK program that displays the topography of the devices that are
plugged into the USB bus on a Linux machine.  It also displays information on
each of the devices.  This can be useful to determine if a device is working
properly or not.

For this program to be useful, you will need to mount the debug filesystem
(debugfs).  Add this line to your /etc/fstab:

  debugfs /sys/kernel/debug debugfs noauto 0 0

Now a simple `mount debugfs` will make the USB info available to USBView.
