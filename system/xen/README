The Xen hypervisor, a powerful open source industry standard for
virtualization, offers a powerful, efficient, and secure feature set for
virtualization of x86, x86_64, IA64, ARM, and other CPU architectures. It
supports a wide range of guest operating systems including Windows, Linux,
Solaris, and various versions of the BSD operating systems.

In order to run Xen, you will need to install and boot from a Xen dom0
kernel. Check README.dom0 (in docs/dom0) for more information on how to do
that.

mbootpack is an optional dependency.  Since booting a Xen kernel with LILO 
is not supported by default we have to use GRUB; alternatively, you can use
mbootpack to create a LILO compatible kernel.

The Xen hypervisor no longer builds on x86 32 bit operating systems.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
