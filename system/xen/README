The Xen hypervisor, a powerful open source industry standard for
virtualization, offers a powerful, efficient, and secure feature set for
virtualization of x86, x86_64, IA64, ARM, and other CPU architectures. It
supports a wide range of guest operating systems including Windows, Linux,
Solaris, and various versions of the BSD operating systems.

mbootpack is an optional dependency, it creates LILO compatible kernel.
libssh2 is also optional dependency, it can be enabled with: LIBSSH2=yes
ocaml-findlib is yet another optional dependency, it builds oxenstored
Additionally, BlueZ support can be enabled with: BLUEZ=yes and ocaml

In order to run Xen, you will need to install and boot from a Xen dom0
kernel. Check README.dom0 (in docs/dom0) for more information on how to do
that. Additionally, README.domU has information about unpriviledged guests.

README.openvswitch-extended explains a bit more advanced aproach to Open
vSwitch setup, more adventureous folk can use:

  INSTALL_OPENVSWITCH_EXTENDED=yes ./xen.SlackBuild

This will install vif script and the config file under /etc/xen, helper
script will be stripped of its .sh suffix and installed into /usr/bin

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
