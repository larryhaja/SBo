ZFS is a modern filesystem originally developed for SOLARIS.
It provides many functionalities such as snapshots, data compression,
data recovery, filesystem (snapshot) sending/reveiving, and more.

NOTE: You'll need the kernel source code to be able to compile this.
This package is kernel dependent, so you'll need to recompile it for
every new kernel you choose to run.

If you're building this for a kernel that isn't currently running,
you'll need to pass what that kernel's 'uname -r' output will be
to the KERN variable when running the build script, e.g. KERN=4.14.9

NOTE: you should run this on x86_64 systems.
