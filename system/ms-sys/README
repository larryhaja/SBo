This program is used to create Microsoft compatible boot records.
It is useful when using Linux to restore a backup of a 
reference Microsoft Windows installation.

Version 2.3.0 added experimental support for NTFS boot record. 
This functionality is mostly useful to identify Windows 7 
NTFS boot records. Writing an NTFS Windows 7 boot record 
will most likely not be of much use. 
(Otherwise excellent for bootable Windows 7 install USB).
