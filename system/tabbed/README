tabbed (framework for embeddable apps)

Simple generic tabbed frontend to xembed aware applications, originally
designed for surf but also usable with many other applications, e.g. st,
uzbl, urxvt, and xterm.

The default width and height for the tabbed window are hard-coded in
the application, and can be set by setting WIDTH and HEIGHT environment
variables.  Default size is 800x600. Example:

  WIDTH=1024 HEIGHT=768 ./tabbed.SlackBuild
