MPICH is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of the
Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard (MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3).
The goals of MPICH are: to provide an MPI implementation that
efficiently supports different computation and communication
platforms including commodity clusters, high-speed networks and
proprietary high-end computing systems, and to enable cutting-edge
research in MPI through an easy-to-extend modular framework for other
derived implementations.
