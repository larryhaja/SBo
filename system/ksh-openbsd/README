This package is a patched version of the OpenBSD ksh ported to Linux, which is
based on the original PD-ksh, but heavily modified and maintained by OpenBSD
developers.
"Patched" means it contains modifications outside of the OpenBSD tree (and
besides the Linux port bits).

See the Changelog.ksh-openbsd and the homepage for more information about the
changes: https://github.com/levaidaniel/ksh-openbsd
