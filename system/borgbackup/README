BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program.
Optionally, it supports compression and authenticated encryption.

The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
for daily backups since only changes are stored. The authenticated
encryption technique makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted
targets.

Borg is a fork of Attic and is maintained by "The Borg collective".

Optional dependencies:
- llfuse (https://slackbuilds.org/apps/llfuse/) is required,
  if you wish to mount an archive as a FUSE filesystem,
- Sphinx (https://slackbuilds.org/apps/Sphinx/) and guzzle_sphinx_theme
  (https://slackbuilds.org/apps/guzzle_sphinx_theme/) are required if
  you wish to build the docs (html, man). Please note that the build
  will fail if Sphinx is installed, but guzzle_sphinx_theme is not.
