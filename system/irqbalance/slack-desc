# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

irqbalance: IRQBalance (IRQ balancing daemon)
irqbalance: 
irqbalance: irqbalance is a Linux daemon that distributes interrupts over the
irqbalance: processors and cores you have in your computer system.  The design goal
irqbalance: of irqbalance is to find a balance between power savings and optimal
irqbalance: performance.  To a large degree, the work irqbalance does is invisible
irqbalance: to you; if irqbalance performs its job correctly, nobody will ever notice
irqbalance: it's there or want to turn it off.
