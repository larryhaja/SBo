The Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) is a Linux kernel module which
provides many of the Solaris kernel APIs.
This shim layer makes it possible to run Solaris kernel code in the
Linux kernel with relatively minimal modification.

This can be particularly useful when you want to track upstream
Solaris development closely and do not want the overhead of
maintaining a large patch which converts Solaris primitives to Linux
primitives.

You need this if you want to run ZFS on Linux.

NOTE: You'll need the kernel source code to be able to compile this.
This package is kernel dependent, so you'll need to recompile it for
every new kernel you choose to run.

If you don't have a /usr/src/linux symlink pointing to your real
kernel directory (the script looks for it there by default), specify
your kernel source destination by

  LINUXPATH=<path to your kernel source> ./spl-solaris.SlackBuild
