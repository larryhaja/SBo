passwdqc - password/passphrase strength checking and enforcement

passwdqc is a password/passphrase strength checking and policy
enforcement toolset, command-line programs (pwqcheck and pwqgen),
and a library (libpasswdqc).

pwqcheck and pwqgen are standalone password/passphrase strength

which are usable from scripts.

libpasswdqc is the underlying library, which may also be used
from third-party programs.
