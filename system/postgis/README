PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially
enables" the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a
backend spatial database for geographic information systems
(GIS).

To disable raster support and eliminate the gdal dependency,
set RASTER=no. If you choose this path, be aware that
postgis will still need the two dependencies that gdal
relies on, proj and geos.

To disable the GTK-based graphical interface for shp2pgsql,
set GUI=no.

This SlackBuild does not build the PostGIS JDBC driver since
the build requires Apache Maven to download dependencies at
build time. The optional dependencies needed to build the
driver are: apache-ant, apache-maven, and postgres-jdbc.
