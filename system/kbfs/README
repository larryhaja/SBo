The Keybase Go Client, filesystem and GUI

This script package the whole bundle, not just the client app.
Choose one between kbfs or keybase. Do not install both.

You will need to create a new user keybasehelper before building
this package.

groupadd -g keybasehelper keybasehelper
useradd -u 352 -g keybasehelper -c "keybase helper user" -s /bin/false keybasehelper

NOTE: Read README.SBo for more instructions!!
google-go-lang and sshfs-fuse are runtime dependencies.

This is still considered an ALPHA release!!
