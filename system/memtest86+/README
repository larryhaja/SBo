Memtest86+ is thorough, stand alone memory test for Intel/AMD x86
architecture systems.  BIOS based memory tests are only a quick check
and often miss failures that are detected by Memtest86+.

Compilation may fail on 64-bit Slackware due to missing
/usr/include/gnu/stubs-32.h from glibc.  If you experience this problem,
copy that file from stubs-64.h in the same directory (or create a symlink),
and you may delete your copy/symlink after you have created the package.

See README.SLACKWARE for setup information.
