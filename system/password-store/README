password-store is a simple password manager which uses GnuPG to 
securely encrypt and retrieve passwords.

By default, bash completion is installed as 
/etc/bash_completion.d/password-store. Add 'source 
/etc/bash_completion.d/password-store' to your .bashrc to enable it.

zsh and fish completion is also optionally included.
uncomment the lines in the SlackBuild to include it in the package.

Documentation is located in the manpages at 'man pass' and online at
