Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that
a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production,
on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.

To use docker as a limited user, add your user to the 'docker' group:

	# groupadd -r -g 281 docker
	# usermod -a -G docker <your_username>

This will require logging out and back in. 

To have the docker daemon start and stop with your host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.docker start
	fi

and to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if needed):

	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.docker stop
	fi

For cgroups, docker does not support mounting cgroups on the "all" single hierarchy controller,
but rather the individual controllers.

To accomplish this, add the following to your /etc/fstab:

  cgroup                                  /cgroup/cpuset          cgroup          rw,relatime,cpuset 0 0
  cgroup                                  /cgroup/cpu             cgroup          rw,relatime,cpu 0 0
  cgroup                                  /cgroup/cpuacct         cgroup          rw,relatime,cpuacct 0 0
  cgroup                                  /cgroup/memory          cgroup          rw,relatime,memory 0 0
  cgroup                                  /cgroup/devices         cgroup          rw,relatime,devices 0 0
  cgroup                                  /cgroup/freezer         cgroup          rw,relatime,freezer 0 0
  cgroup                                  /cgroup/net_cls         cgroup          rw,relatime,net_cls 0 0
  cgroup                                  /cgroup/blkio           cgroup          rw,relatime,blkio 0 0
