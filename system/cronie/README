Cronie contains the standard UNIX daemon crond that runs specified programs
at scheduled times and related tools. It is based on the original cron and
has security and configuration enhancements like the ability to use pam
and SELinux.

By default this SlackBuild will include anacron in the package. If you
don't want this, pass ANACRON=no to the SlackBuild.

Note that Slackware has dcron - Dillon's Cron daemon. This package will
conflict with this package. It is advised to remove dcron before installing
cronie:

	Stop the dcron daemon:
	# pgrep crond
	# kill <crond_pid>
	Remove the dcron package:
	# removepkg dcron
	# rm -rf /var/spool/cron

Slackware's boot script assumes that you have dcron and thus has to be
modified:

Change this line in /etc/rc.d/rc.M

	/usr/sbin/crond -l notice

to:

	/usr/sbin/crond
