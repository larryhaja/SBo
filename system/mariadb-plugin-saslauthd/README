This MariaDB plugin authenticates database users against the system
password file /etc/shadow or other authentication mechanisms supported
by saslauthd.

Enable the saslauthd daemon with:

  chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.saslauthd
  /etc/rc.d/rc.saslauthd start

Restart MariaDB after package installation to enable the plugin.

To create a database user which uses saslauthd, use

  CREATE USER username@hostname IDENTIFIED WITH saslauthd;

Optionally, a different system user as well as a realm can be specified.
Example:

  CREATE USER 'jekyll' IDENTIFIED WITH saslauthd AS 'hyde@EXAMPLE.COM';

saslauthd needs clear text passwords. Secure non-local connections
between your database clients and the server with TLS. See the MariaDB
documentation for more information.
