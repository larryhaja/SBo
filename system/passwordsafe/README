Password Safe - password database utility (BETA)

Portable version of the password manager program originally designed by Bruce
Schneier. pwsafe is the Linux version of the popular Windows PasswordSafe
password manager.

pwsafe supports Yubicos Yubikey, a unique USB and NFC device offering one-touch
authentication and supporting multiple authentication protocols for all devices
and platfroms - with no driver or client software needed.

To compile the package without Yubikey support pass NO_YUBI=1 to the script:
NO_YUBI=1 ./passwordsafe.SlackBuild

In this case you don't need libyubikey and ykpers packages.

Read passwordsafe.info for additional dependencies.
