Linux Processor Microcode Data File

The microcode data file contains the latest microcode definitions for all Intel processors.
Intel releases microcode updates to correct processor behavior as documented in the respective
processor specification updates. While the regular approach to getting this microcode update
is via a BIOS upgrade, Intel realizes that this can be an administrative hassle. The Linux
operating system and VMware ESX products have a mechanism to update the microcode after booting.

This script is intended to repackage the official Intel microcode tarball.
The resulting firmware file is placed under /lib/firmware/microcode.dat

NOTE:
Although there is another (newer) mean of uploading the microcode data file to the processor,
this package is meant to be used with the *microcode_ctl* utility available at slackbuilds.org.
