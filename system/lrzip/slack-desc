# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lrzip: This is a compression program optimised for large files. The larger
lrzip: the file and the more memory you have, the better the compression
lrzip: advantage this will provide, especially once the files are larger
lrzip: than 100MB. The advantage can be chosen to be either size (much 
lrzip: smaller than bzip2) or speed (much faster than bzip2).
