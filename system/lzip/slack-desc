# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lzip: Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov
lzip: chain-Algorithm) algorithm designed by Igor Pavlov.  Lzip decompresses
lzip: almost as fast as gzip and compresses better than bzip2, but requires
lzip: more memory and time during compression. These features make lzip well
lzip: suited for software distribution and data archival.
