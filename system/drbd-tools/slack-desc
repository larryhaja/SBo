# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

drbd-tools: drbd-tools (Userland Tools for Distributed Replicated Block Device)
drbd-tools:
drbd-tools: DRBD is a block device which is designed to build high availability
drbd-tools: clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via
drbd-tools: (a dedicated) network. You could see it as a network RAID1. DRBD
drbd-tools: takes over the data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to
drbd-tools: the other host. On the other host, it takes it to the disk there.
