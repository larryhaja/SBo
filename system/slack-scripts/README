slack-scripts (Some Slackware Utilities)

ph - A Slackware Package History
slkcfg - A Sysvinit Script Utility

===============================================================================

ph N

Lists last installed N packages by date order, newest first unless N is
negative, then it lists oldest first. With no number it outputs all, suitable
for grepping etc.

It supports a few options about listing style such as date, tag, version, and
can be used in conjunction with other applications such as removepkg.

Example:

ph -s 5         (list last 5 slackbuilds.org packages installed)
ph -t alien 10  (list last 10 packages with tag 'alien')
ph -d 5         (list last 5 without printing the dates)
pn -v 5         (list last 5 without printing versions)

Or combine them:

ph -v -d -s 5  (list only the names of the last 5 slackbuilds.org packages)

It also supports the $ROOT environmental option so that it will work with mounted
file systems and partitions.

See ph -h for more details and ph --help for more examples.

===============================================================================

slkcfg runs commands on the rc scripts in /etc/rc.d/ but without needing to
specify the full path. Any output is printed.

It can run the usual start/stop/restart/status commands and set/unset the
executable bit.

eg:

slkcfg cups on|off (chmod +/-x)
slkcfg cups start|stop|status

and so on.

It greps the rc file to find options. If it doesn't find any options but you
know that some exist you can force the command by adding 'force' at the end.

Running with just the name of the rc file will 'ls -l' it and print any found
options.

/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 is treated specially and will try to find the names of
interfaces using ifconfig -a.

At the moment it supports the following: eth, wlan, br, virbr, vmnet, vboxnet,
pan and ppp.

If you would like me to add extra interface support just drop me a line with
the details or send a patch.

Example output from inet1:

slkcfg inet1                                                                      (viins)
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 10878 Nov 19  2015 /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1*

Options:
start stop restart
lo_start lo_stop
eth0_start eth0_stop eth0_restart
virbr0_start virbr0_stop virbr0_restart
wlan0_start wlan0_stop wlan0_restart

slkcfg uses 'sh' to run commands (apart from chmod) so it should work even if
the rc file isn't executable. In that case it will print a message to tell you
at the end of the output.

See slkcfg -h for more details.
