# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

chrpath: chrpath (modify rpath of binaries)
chrpath:
chrpath: chrpath allows you to modify the dynamic library load path (rpath) of
chrpath: compiled programs.  Currently, only removing and modifying the rpath
chrpath: is supported.  Eventually, I hope to be able to add an rpath if it is
chrpath: missing.
