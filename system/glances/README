glances is a free (LGPL), cross-platform, curses-based system monitoring tool
which aims to present a maximum of information in a minimum of space, ideally
to fit in a classical 80x24 terminal, or larger for additional data. It can
adapt the displayed information dynamically, depending on the terminal size.
A client/server mode is also available and remote monitoring can be done via
terminal or a web interface.

glances is written in Python and uses the psutil library to fetch statistical
values from key elements, like CPU, load average, memory, network, disks, file
systems, processes, etc.
