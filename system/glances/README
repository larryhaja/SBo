Glances is a free (LGPL) cross-platform curses-based system monitoring tool
which aims to present a maximum of information in a minimum of space, ideally
to fit in a classical 80x24 terminal, or larger for additional data: in fact
it can adapt dynamically the displayed information depending on the terminal
size.

This tool can also work in client/server mode. Remote monitoring can be
done via terminal or web interface.

Glances is written in Python and uses the psutil library to fetch statistical
values from key elements, like CPU, load average, memory, network, disks,
file systems, processes, etc.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES

Available on SBo: hddtemp (HHD temperature monitoring support), py3sensors
(HW monitoring support), batinfo (battery monitoring support), bottle (Web
server mode), pymdstat (RAID support), ysnmp (SNMP support), netifaces (auto
discoverer mode), statsd (StatsD export module), matplotlib (generation of
graphs from history data) and python3.

Not available on SBo: influxdb (InfluxDB export module), pystache (action
script feature), docker-py (Docker monitoring support), zeroconf (auto
discoverer mode).

NOTES

1) When launching Glances in a terminal with a bright background, the
option '--theme-white' is recommended.

2) For the optional auto discoverer mode, both zeroconf and netifaces
are needed.
