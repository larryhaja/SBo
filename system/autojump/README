Autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by
maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the
command line.  You need to work a little bit before the database
becomes usable. Autojump will listen and rank your 'cd' commands by
frequency. Once your database is reasonably complete, you can "jump"
to a commonly "cd"ed directory.  It supports the bash, zsh, and
tcsh shells.
