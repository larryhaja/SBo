lhasa (Free Software replacement for UNIX LHA tool)

Lhasa is a Free Software replacement for the Unix LHA tool, for
decompressing .lzh (LHA / LHarc) and .lzs (LArc) archives. The backend for
the tool is a library, so that it can be reused for other purposes. Lhasa
aims to be compatible with as many types of lzh/lzs archives as
possible. It also aims to generate the same output as the (non-free)
Unix LHA tool, so that it will act as a drop-in free replacement.

Note that lhasa is only for *decompressing*, not compressing/creating
archives.

The binary is installed as /usr/bin/lhasa. If installing on a system that
doesn't already have Slackware's lha package, symlinks will be created
so lhasa can be called as /usr/bin/lha (and "man lha" will work). This
allows lhasa to replace Slackware's lha package, but doesn't conflict
if both are installed.
