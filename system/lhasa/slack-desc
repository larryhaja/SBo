# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lhasa: lhasa (Free Software replacement for UNIX LHA tool)
lhasa:
lhasa: Lhasa is a Free Software replacement for the Unix LHA tool, for
lhasa: decompressing .lzh (LHA / LHarc) and .lzs (LArc) archives. The
lhasa: backend for the tool is a library, so that it can be reused for
lhasa: other purposes. Lhasa aims to be compatible with as many types of
lhasa: lzh/lzs archives as possible. It also aims to generate the same
lhasa: output as the (non-free) Unix LHA tool, so that it will act as a
lhasa: drop-in free replacement.
