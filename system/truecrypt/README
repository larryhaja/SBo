TrueCrypt is free open-source disk encryption software for
Windows 7/Vista/XP, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Since version 6.1a of TrueCrypt, a number of header files from RSA
Laboratories are required during the compilation. I've separated the
installation of these into a separate package called cryptoki rather
than have this script extract a separate, isolated archive. 

This script does not create the static GUI build seen elsewhere.
