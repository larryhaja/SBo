The Public Type (PT) fonts are free OFL licensed fonts released in
2009-2011 by the ParaType company.  They consists of PT Sans (includes 8
styles), PT Serif (6 styles), and PT Mono (2 styles) families.

The fonts cover a long list of Eurasian languages based on Latin and
Cyrillic scripts.

The PT fonts were primarily designed by Alexandra Korolkova.

The texlive-fonts package contains a different variant of PT fonts in
/usr/share/texmf-dist/fonts/truetype/paratype/
The present package contains fonts with the truetype specific
hhea-metrics adapted for linux environment.

PT fonts are primarily designed to be used with subpixel hinting (aka
ClearType) activated.

When using subpixel hinting, it is recommended to disable embedded
bitmaps for these fonts by using the following fontconfig setting:

<edit name="embeddedbitmap" mode="assign">
  <bool>false</bool>
</edit>
