Slpkg is a powerful software package manager that installs, updates
and removes packages on Slackware based systems. It automatically
computes dependencies and figures out what things should occur
to install packages. Slpkg makes it easier to maintain groups
of machines without having to manually update.

Optional dependencies:
    - python2-pythondialog (for dialog box interface)
    - pygraphviz (for drawing dependencies diagram)
    - graph-easy (for drawing ascii dependencies diagram)
    - aria2 (alternative downloader)
    - httpie (alternative downloader)
