fwupdate - Tools for using the ESRT and UpdateCapsule() to apply firmware
updates

The actual binary (fwup*.efi) is not automatically installed to your ESP.
Copying it from /usr/libexec/fwupdate/ is left to be handled by the package
admin.

If you do not use the standard directory (/boot/efi/EFI/Slackware), you'll
also need to adjust /usr/libexec/fwupdate/cleanup to cleanup the correct
directory.

I have not actually used this efi binary for anything yet. This package
provides the libs needed by fwupd to update firmware, which is what I am
using it for.

The efi binary is included however for completeness.
