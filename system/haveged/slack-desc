# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haveged: The haveged project is an attempt to provide an easy-to-use,
haveged: unpredictable random number generator based upon an adaptation of the
haveged: HAVEGE algorithm.  Haveged was created to remedy low-entropy
haveged: conditions in the Linux random device that can occur under some
haveged: workloads, especially on headless servers.
