# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

man-db:
man-db: This package provides the man command and related utilities
man-db: for examining on-line help files (manual pages). It can act as a
man-db: replacement for Slackware's man package. It has several enhancements
man-db: over man, including an indexed database for searches with -k or
man-db: apropos, the ability to easily view man pages in a browser, better
man-db: i18n support, and a much more efficient implementation of the -K
man-db: (full text search) option.
