wmfsm is a WindowMaker dock application that shows the amount of disk space available
on mounted file systems with colored bars.
   

   
NOTE 1: You may choose one of the "wmfsm_*.xpm" avaiable in wmfsm directory.
        Just choose one you liked more and use it as "wmfsm_master.xpm"
        Than, recreate the "tar.gz" source file and run the SlackBuild script.
        
NOTE 2: Copy the "wmfsmrc.sample" to "~/.wmfsmrc" and edit it to configure your
        shown filesystems. You may exclude or include with first line either
        [include] or [exclude].  The next lines are filesystems that are either
        explicitly included or excluded respectively.
