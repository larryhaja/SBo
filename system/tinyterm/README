tinyterm is a simple X terminal emulator written in C.

It supports Ctrl + Shift + C and Ctrl + Shift + V for copy and paste actions.

Most of tinyterm's configuration is compiled in, rather than being read
from config files or command-line options. To build a customized tinyterm,
copy config.h from the tinyterm source to the SlackBuild's directory and
edit as you see fit. Probably the most important change for most people
will be to increase the font size (TINYTERM_FONT).
