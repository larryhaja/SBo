Hack -  A typeface in the Bitstream Vera lineage

Hack has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and
includes the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects.

The face has been re-designed with an expanded glyph set, modifications
of the original glyph shapes, and meticulous attention to metrics.
