# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zeroinstall-injector: zeroinstall-injector (The Zero Install Injector)
zeroinstall-injector:
zeroinstall-injector: A running process is created by combining many different libraries
zeroinstall-injector: (and other components). In the Zero Install world, we have all
zeroinstall-injector: versions of each library available at all times. The problem is then
zeroinstall-injector: choosing which to use.
zeroinstall-injector:
zeroinstall-injector: The injector solves this problem by selecting components to meet a
zeroinstall-injector: program's requirements according to user policy. The injector finds
zeroinstall-injector: out which versions are available and downloads and runs the ones
zeroinstall-injector: you choose.
