jmtpfs is a FUSE and libmtp based filesystem for accessing MTP 
(Media Transfer Protocol) devices. It was specifically designed 
for exchaning files between Linux (and Mac OS X) systems and 
newer Android devices that support MTP but not USB Mass Storage.

The goal is to create a well behaved filesystem, allowing tools 
like find and rsync to work as expected. MTP file types are set 
automatically based on file type detection using libmagic. 
Setting the file appears to be necessary for some Android apps, 
like  Gallery, to be able to find and use the files.
