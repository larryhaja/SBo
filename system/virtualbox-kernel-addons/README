This are the supplementary kernel drivers for the VirtualBox
virtualization environment to be used within a guest.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
  KERNEL=2.6.38.8 ./virtualbox-kernel.SlackBuild

If you want to build a kernel module for an other virtualbox version
you can use the included "virtualbox-kernel-addons-mksrctarball.sh"
which will generate the needed source package for you. You will need
to have the coresponding virtualbox-ose-addons version already installed.

This package is intended to be used on GUEST / VIRTUAL MACHINES running
Slackware, NOT the host system.
