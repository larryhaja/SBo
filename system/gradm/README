Gradm, the administration utility for the role-based access control 
system, is a powerful tool that parses your ACLs (Access Control Lists), 
performs the enforcement of a secure base policy, optimizes the ACLs, 
as well as handles parsing of the learning logs, merges them with your 
ACL set, and outputs the final ACLs.

Before you install gradm, boot into your patched grsecurity kernel. 
You can compile gradm in any kernel you wish, but the installation will 
fail if the kernel does not support grsecurity.
