heirloom-doctools (classic implementation of the troff tools)

The Heirloom Documentation Tools package provides troff, nroff, and 
related utilities to format manual pages and other documents for 
output on terminals and printers. They are portable and enhanced 
versions of the utilities released by Sun as part of OpenSolaris, 
which are a variant of ditroff, which, in turn, descends to the 
historical Unix troff that generated output for the C/A/T 
phototypesetter.

Tarball / CVS version:
This SlackBuild can be used for the tarball-version, but also for 
a cvs checkout version. To use the cvs version use:

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@heirloom.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/heirloom login
CVS password:<just type return>
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@heirloom.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/heirloom co -P heirloom-doctools

in this directory and call the SlackBuild with
VERSION=latest ./heirloom-doctools.SlackBuild

Path settings:
The files get installed into /opt/heirloom . The included
/etc/profile.d/heirloom.sh script sets the PATH to include this
directory _in front of_ the usual paths, so that troff points
to the heirloom version, not the gnu version. To enable this
behaviour, make the heirloom.sh script executable.
