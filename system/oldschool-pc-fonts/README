oldschool-pc-fonts (remakes of PC text mode fonts)

The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack brings you pixel-perfect remakes of
various type styles from text-mode era PCs - in modern, multi-platform,
Unicode-compatible TrueType form, and/or as Linux .psfu console fonts.

By default, the package will include TrueType fonts. To also include
console fonts, install graphics/psftools before running this script.
If you only want console fonts, set TTF=no in the script's environment.
See README_console.txt for more information.
