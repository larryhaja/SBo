This is the kernel-module needed by the proprietary binary nvidia driver.
You also need the nvidia-legacy173-driver package from SlackBuilds.org.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
    KERNEL=2.6.33.7 ./nvidia-legacy173-kernel.SlackBuild
