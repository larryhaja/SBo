v86d provides a backend for kernel drivers that need to execute
x86 BIOS code.  The code is executed in a controlled environment
and the results are passed back to the kernel via the netlink
interface.

To compile using glibc, pass OPT="--default" to the script.
(i.e. 
	OPT=--default ./v86d.SlackBuild
	OPT=--default sh v86d.SlackBuild
)

Compiling against glibc will result in a dynamically linked
executable that is _not suitable_ for inclusion in initrds.
