univga-font (unicode terminal font)

UNI-VGA is a Unicode VGA font for X11 and console. It is primarily
intended to be the single source of fonts for console and for XDosEmu.

One of the aims while creating the font was its internal consistency. For
example, accented glyphs shouldn't differ too much from unaccented ones,
as it was in original IBM's VGA font. It also allowed to render Latin
Extended Additional glyphs with two accents, which was impossible with
IBM's accents' size.

X11 calls the font "-bolkhov-vga-medium-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1"
and an alias called "univga" is added, so you can say e.g. "xterm -fn univga".

Also 3 varieties of the font are installed for use with the Linux console:
AsianCyr-vga-8x16, WinCyr-vga-8x16, and UniCyrX-vga-8x16. They can be
used in /etc/rc.d/rc.font, but won't show up in the setconsolefont menu.
