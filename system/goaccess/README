Goaccess is an open source real-time Apache log analyzer and
interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems.
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system
administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.

Optional:

GeoIP:

Goaccess now supports two types of GeoIP - legacy and mmdb.

If you want to add GeoIP support, pass either option to the
slackbuild:

GEOIP=legacy ./goaccess.SlackBuild
GEOIP=mmdb ./goaccess.SlackBuild

At the moment, mmdb is not on slackbuilds.org.

TokyoCabinet:

Goaccess supports Tokyo Cabinet and Tokyo Cabinet's on-disk B+ Tree
database.

The options are:

TCB=memhash ./goaccess.SlackBuild
TCB=btree ./goaccess.SlackBuild
