goaccess is an open source real-time Apache log analyzer and 
interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems. 
It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system 
administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.

If you wish to add GeoIP support, please pass the GEOIP=yes
to the script, GEOIP=yes ./goaccess.SlackBuild
