Some post installation tasks need to be done like the autostarting of tlp
via an entry /etc/rc.d/rc.local, and a post-installation script mentioned
at http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-developer-documentation.html.

    fi
done

# Start the tlp service
/etc/rc.d/rc.tlp start

# Restart acpid
/etc/rc.d/rc.acpid restart

# Configure tlp to be run at startup
add "/etc/rc.d/rc.tlp start" (without quotes) to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

# Give execute permission to rc.tlp
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.tlp

After removal of this package you would need to revert the above changes.
Please make sure that you stopped the TLP service before removing TLP.
