mkslack - a SlackBuild generator script

This slackbuild generator uses templates stored in
/usr/share/mkslack/templates and a config file
/etc/mkslack/mkslack.conf which you must edit for name, email, tag and
a few options.


Idea for use:

The initial slackbuild and info file are built by this script, and
when a test build/install is done and working, the files should be
tweaked by hand. Especially don't forget to fill in the rest of the
details in the .info. One thing to point out is that mkslack will
overwrite these files if run again unless you set KEEPBACKUPS="YES"
in the conf (default).

This is only a starter kit! You ARE expected to edit the created
files by hand afterwards to remove unnecesary parts and add extra
options!


Syntax:

mkslack [options] archive

Options:
-h --help               Usage.
-b --build              Run SlackBuild after creation. Got root?
-i --install            Install the package after running.
-l --list               Pipe archive contents to /usr/bin/most and exit.
-v --version            Version of mkslack.
-V --ckver              Check for new version.

With no option set, mkslack will generate the SlackBuild and other
files, print out a small message, and then quit.


Config options:

NAME, EMAIL as they should appear in .SlackBuild and .info TAG should
be your custom tag and defaults to _SBo KEEPBACKUPS="YES|NO" up to 5
backups of .SlackBuild and other files are kept. The higher the
number, the older they are.  ERRORACTION="PROMPT|AUTO|EXIT" what to
do on build errors. Using AUTO or answering 'y' to the prompt will
have the slackbuild adjusted for man and info pages and then rebuilt.
Waf scripts don't exit on a '1' return code so it scans the end of
the to see if there is an unrecognised configure option (the most
frequent error with waf).


CLI Options:

The documents list in top level of source tree can be adjusted by
command:
DOCS="SomeFile" mkslack archive
This will add 'SomeFile' to the list. You can also edit the DOCS list
in this script. Any that it doesn't find will be removed from the
list.

Build can be specified by:
BUILD=2 mkslack archive
Otherwise it defaults to 1.

ARCH can be specified by:
ARCH=xxx mkslack archive
It defaults to whatever is set in the system, or what the SlackBuild
finds or sets.

TAG can also be specified.
