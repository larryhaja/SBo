# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Authen-PAM: Authen::PAM (Perl interface to PAM library)
perl-Authen-PAM:
perl-Authen-PAM: The Authen::PAM module provides a Perl interface to the PAM library.
perl-Authen-PAM: The only difference with the standard PAM interface is that instead
perl-Authen-PAM: of passing a pam_conv struct which has an additional context
perl-Authen-PAM: parameter appdata_ptr, you must only give an address to a
perl-Authen-PAM: conversation function written in Perl.
