# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Scalar-List-Utils:
perl-Scalar-List-Utils: List::Util and Scalar::Util contains a selection of subroutines that
perl-Scalar-List-Utils: people have expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the
perl-Scalar-List-Utils: usage and/or the size would not warrant the use of a keyword and an
perl-Scalar-List-Utils: individual extension would be wasteful.
