Convert::UU -- Perl module for uuencode and uudecode

- uuencode

uuencode() takes as the first argument a string that is to 
be uuencoded. Note, that it is the string that is encoded, 
not a filename. Alternatively a filehandle may be passed 
that must be opened for reading. It returns the uuencoded 
string including begin and end. Second and third argument 
are optional and specify filename and mode. If unspecified 
these default to "uuencode.uu" and 644.

- uudecode

uudecode() takes a string as argument which will be uudecoded. 
If the argument is a filehandle this handle will be read 
instead. If it is a reference to an ARRAY, the elements are 
treated like lines that form a string. Leading and trailing 
garbage will be ignored. The function returns the uudecoded 
string for the first begin/end pair. In array context it 
returns an array whose first element is the uudecoded string, 
the second is the filename and the third is the mode.
