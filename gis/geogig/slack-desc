# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

geogig: geogig (Distributed version control for geospatial data)
geogig:
geogig: geogig is a distributed version control system specially designed to
geogig: handle geospatial data. geogig draws inspiration from Git, but adapts
geogig: its core concepts to handle versioning of spatial data. Users are able
geogig: to import raw geospatial data (such as Shapefiles, PostGIS or
geogig: SpatiaLite) into a repository where every change to the data is
geogig: tracked. These changes can be viewed in a history, reverted, branched
geogig: into sandboxed areas, merged back in or pushed to remote repositories.
