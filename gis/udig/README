uDig is an open source desktop and internet GIS application framework. The
project goal is to provide a complete Java solution for desktop GIS data
access, editing and viewing. 

uDig aims to be:
- User friendly, providing a familiar graphical environment for GIS users;
- Desktop located, running as a thick client
- Internet oriented, consuming standard (WMS, WFS, WPS) and de facto (GeoRSS, 
  KML, tiles) geospatial web services; and, GIS ready, providing the
  framework on which complex analytical capabilities can be built, and gradually
  subsuming those capabilities into the main application.
