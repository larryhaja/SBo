PROJ is a generic coordinate transformation software, that transforms
coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another. This
includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations.

This SlackBuild also includes the datum grid files for PROJ (excluding the
regional resource packages).
