GeoServer is a Java-base server that allows users to publish and edit
geospatial data using open standards.

GeoServer is the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium's
Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards, as well as
a high-performance Web Map Service (WMS). Additional functionality is available
through the use of plugins.

This SlackBuild will install GeoServer as a web application for a Tomcat
servlet container. The SlackBuild will not overwrite any geoserver.war file
that has been deployed using /var/lib/tomcat/webapps, but by default they will
both be using the same /geoserver web path. This path can be changed from its
default by editing /etc/tomcat/Catalina/localhost/geoserver.xml.

The SlackBuild will create a data directory for GeoServer at /var/lib/geoserver
but will not add any content, meaning that uninstalls, reinstalls, and upgrades
will not affect existing data directories. Nevertheless, the data directory
should still always be backed up prior to an upgrade. An empty data directory
will be populated by a minimal set of configuration files when GeoServer is
started for the first time.

The jai and jai-imageio packages are recommended for improved image rendering
performance.
