geopy makes it easy for developers to locate the coordinates of addresses,
cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party
geocoders and other data sources, such as wikis.

geopy currently includes support for six geocoders: Google Maps, Yahoo!
Maps, Windows Local Live (Virtual Earth), geocoder.us, GeoNames, MediaWiki
pages (with the GIS extension), and Semantic MediaWiki pages.

See http://code.google.com/p/geopy/wiki/GettingStarted for more details.
