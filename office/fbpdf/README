fbpdf (PDF viewer for the Linux framebuffer)

fbpdf is a framebuffer pdf/djvu file viewer. It can use either mupdf or
poppler libraries for rendering pdf files and it uses djvulibre library
for rendering djvu files.

By default, the fbpdf2 (poppler support) executable is built, along
with fbdjvu. If you want mupdf support, install mupdf before running
this build and it will be auto-detected. The executable that uses mupdf
will be called fbpdf.

This build includes a patch that makes the keyboard controls behave more
like other PDF readers. Mainly, it lets you page through the entire
document with the space bar (and backspace to go back), rather than
requiring separate keystrokes for "scroll within current page" and "go
to next page". If you prefer the original behaviour, set PRISTINE=yes
in the script's environment.
