# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kchmviewer-qt:
kchmviewer-qt: KchmViewer is a CHM (MS HTML help file format) viewer written in
kchmviewer-qt: C++. Unlike most existing CHM viewers for Unix, it uses the
kchmviewer-qt: Trolltech Qt widget library and does not depend on KDE or Gnome.
kchmviewer-qt: However, it may be compiled with full KDE support, including KDE
kchmviewer-qt: widgets and KIO/KHTML. This is Qt-only version.
