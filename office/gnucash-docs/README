This is the documentation package for Gnucash.

This builds the internal help and user guides for Gnucash.

For the EPUB help and user guides, pass EPUB="yes" to the script.

For the PDF help and user guides, make sure fop is installed and
  configured, and pass PDF="yes" to the script.

For the HTML help and user guides to read outside the Gnucash
application, pass HTML="yes" to the script.

For a specific language, pass DOCLANG="xx", where xx is:
C for English (default)
de for German
it for Italian
pt for Portugese
ja for Japanese (guide only, no help - defaults to C)
ru for Russian (guide only, no help - defaults to C)

Note: This script builds the internal guides in all available
languages, but the HTML guides are only in the spacified language
to save space and avoid any excessive package bloat.
