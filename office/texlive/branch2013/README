This directory should contain only patches from the stable branch of 
TeXLive 2013 <http://tug.org/svn/texlive/branches/branch2013>

Thanks to Karl Berry and the other TeXLive contributors for agreeing
to maintain this and for linking it at http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html

This will fetch a local svn checkout:
  svn co svn://tug.org/texlive/branches/branch2013

From an svn checkout, something like this will generate patches:
  svn diff -r from#####:to##### > patchname
