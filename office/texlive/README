TeXLive (TeXLive binaries, support files, TeX formats)

This package contains most binaries, support files, TeX formats and
packages, and other files included in the TeXLive TeX distribution.
Included are input files for TeX, runtime configuration files,
hyphenation tables, manpages, and the computer modern fonts.

Some extra texmf can be found in the "texlive-texmf-extra" package
and all of the docs can be found in the "texlive-texmf-docs" package,
both of which are available at SlackBuilds.org.

Have a look at the texscythe package to see how the texmf archives were
created from the original download from upstream.

The resulting packages are large, and a lot of space is required during
the build processes, so you might want to consider defining an alternate
location for TMP and OUTPUT if you have small /tmp partition.

Note that this package is intended to completely replace (and then some) the
tetex packages in Slackware, so you'll need to remove tetex and tetex-doc
before installing TeXLive.
