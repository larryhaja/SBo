Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. It currently 
supports pdf, postscript, djvu, tiff and dvi. The goal of evince is to 
replace the multiple document viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop 
with a single simple application.

Evince is specifically designed to support the following file formats:
* PDF
* Postscript
* djvu
* tiff
* dvi
Texlive is an optional dependency (for dvi support).

This uses dconf (runtime-only) to save various settings (and even 
then, not ALL settings are saved).
