KBibTeX is a BibTeX editor for KDE to edit bibliographies used with
LaTeX. KBibTeX is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) version 2
or any later version.

KBibTeX for KDE 4 is currently under development. KBibTeX for KDE 4 is
mature for most daily tasks, but still lacks some features. It is
recommended that you make backups of all your files before editing
them with KBibTeX for KDE 4.
