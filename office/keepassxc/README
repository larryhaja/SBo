KeePassXC is a password and personal data management application that supports
the KeePass Password Safe file format.

KeePassXC is a fork of KeePassX that aims to incorporate stalled Pull Requests,
features, and bug fixes that are not being incorporated into the main KeePassX
baseline. KeePassXC may be installed alongside KeePassX (also available as a
SlackBuild).

KeePassXC can be built with YubiKey two-factor authentication support for
unlocking the database. This introduces a dependency on ykpers and can be
enabled by passing XC_YUBIKEY=ON to the script.

KeePassXC will be built with browser support, meaning it can function as
password storage for Mozilla Firefox and Chromium/Chrome. This may be disabled
by passing XC_BROWSER=OFF to the script.

KeePassXC will be built with SSH agent support, meaning that KeepassXC can
interact with a running agent. This may be disabled by passing XC_SSHAGENT=OFF
to the script.

KeePassXC will be built with networking support, meaning that website favicons
can be downloaded. This maybe disabled by passing XC_NETWORKING=OFF to the script.

Autotype may be disabled by passing XC_AUTOTYPE=OFF.
