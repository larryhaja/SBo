Osmo is a handy personal organizer, which includes calendar, tasks manager,
address book and notes modules. It was designed to be a small, easy to use and
good  looking PIM tool to help to manage personal information. In its current
state the  organizer is quite convenient to use - for example, the user can
perform nearly all operations using the keyboard. Also, a lot of parameters
are configurable to meet the user's preferences. On the technical side, Osmo
is GTK+ based tool which uses a plain XML database to store all personal data.

Optional build-time dependencies are: libgringotts and webkitgtk.
