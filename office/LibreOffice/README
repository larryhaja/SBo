LibreOffice is a powerful office suite; its clean interface and powerful tools
let you unleash your creativity and grow your productivity. LibreOffice embeds
several applications that make it the most powerful Free & Open Source Office
suite on the market: Writer, the word processor, Calc, the spreadsheet
application, Impress, the presentation engine, Draw, our drawing and
flowcharting application, Base, our database and database frontend,
and Math for editing mathematics.

This SlackBuild builds the entire project from its source code. In seeking a
fully functional LibreOffice, most optional features are included by default.
Build time environment variables that may set to vary features are as follows.
1. enable (disabled by default) the experimental VLC avmedia backend with:
	VLC="yes"
2. disable (enabled by default) use of avahi with:
	AVAHI="no"
