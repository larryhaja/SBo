KmyMoney is a simple financial accounting manager for KDE for personal or
small-business use.  It is a full double-entry accounting software package.
Updating to version 4.6.6 is needed because banks are dropping support for
the Quicken version ID used by KMyMoney for online imports.
libofx 0.9.4+ is an optional dependency to support ofxbanking.
