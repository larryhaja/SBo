# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rastertospp: rastertospp (CUPS raster converter)
rastertospp:
rastertospp: The rastertospp is a CUPS raster converter that takes a cups-raster
rastertospp: as its input, and on the output spits a stream of data suitable for
rastertospp: direct sending to the printer. This is one possible form of a driver
rastertospp: for CUPS, the one which makes most sense in the case of this printer.
rastertospp: Print quality of this driver seems the same as from the Windows
rastertospp: driver, no color profiling is done. As of version 1.1 there is an
rastertospp: "Avoid clipping" option (default: on) which in some cases yields
rastertospp: better results than stock Windows driver.
