Luminance HDR is an HDR imaging tool.  It creates an HDR file from a
set of images (JPEG, TIFF 8 and 16 bit, RAW) of the same scene taken
at different exposure settings.  You can save and load HDR images,
rotate and resize them, tonemap your images, and copy your EXIF data.

Luminance HDR was formerly named qtpfsgui.

To run Luminance HDR, your processor must support SSE2 instructions
(i.e. Pentium 4 or higher, or Athlon 64 or higher).

hugin is an optional runtime dependency (for aligning multiple LDR
exposures).
