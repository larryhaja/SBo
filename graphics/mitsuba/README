PREAMBLE
--------

Mitsuba is a GPLv3 research-oriented rendering system in the style of
PBRT. It is written in C++, implements unbiased as well as biased techniques, 
and contains heavy optimizations targeted towards current CPU
architectures. 

Mitsuba places a strong emphasis on experimental rendering techniques, 
such as path-based formulations of Metropolis Light Transport and 
volumetric modeling approaches.

This SlackBuild uses a git snapshot from 7 Feb 2015.


BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------

Mitsuba requires libglewmx. Slackware ships with GLEW but it has not been compiled to include libglewmx,
so you will have to re-compile and re-install it manually.

To do this, get the glew Slackbuild from your install disc (or your nearest Slackware mirror) and the glew source code.
Compile as normal, but your install line should be:

make install.all GLEW_DEST=$PKG/usr
(where $PKG is your DESTDIR, which you will run makepkg against)

Install your new version of glew and then build Mitsuba. 


SEE ALSO
--------
There is a handy Mitsuba Blender plugin available from SlackBuilds.org so that you can use Mitsuba as your Blender renderer.
