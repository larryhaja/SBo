ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization
application. ParaView users can quickly build visualizations to analyze their
data using qualitative and quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be
done interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView's batch
processing capabilities.

Although not recommended, building without MPI (mpich) and/or Matplotlib support
is possible by setting the relevant variables in the build environment:
  MPICH=no
  MATPLOTLIB=no

This build incorporates the ParaView "Getting Started" and "Tutorial"
documentation. In addition, the official ParaView Guide is available from:
    http://www.paraview.org/files/v5.1/ParaViewGuide-5.1.0.pdf
For access to the Guide directly from the ParaView graphical interface
(using Help menu or F1 key), it should be stored as
    /usr/doc/paraview-5.1.2/Guide.pdf
