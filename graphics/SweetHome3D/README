Sweet Home 3D is a free interior design application
that helps you draw the plan of your house, arrange
furniture on it and visit the results in 3D.

As a workaround for a java3d crash when using the
Nvidia proprietary driver, try:

NVIDIA=yes ./SweetHome3D.SlackBuild

This will use an older version of java3D. Also, if
SweetHome3D fails to run with OpenJDK, remove it and
install the the official jdk on Slackbuilds.org
