# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wayland-egl: wayland-egl (mesa EGL component)
wayland-egl:
wayland-egl: EGL is an interface between Khronos rendering APIs (such as OpenGL,
wayland-egl: OpenGL ES or OpenVG) and the underlying native platform windowing
wayland-egl: system. EGL handles graphics context management, surface/buffer
wayland-egl: binding, rendering synchronization, and enables "high-performance,
wayland-egl: accelerated, mixed-mode 2D APIs". EGL is managed by the non-profit
wayland-egl: technology consortium Khronos Group.
wayland-egl: The Wayland display server protocol uses EGL. If you build qt5 with
wayland-egl: its optional dependency wayland and then build vlc then vlc will
wayland-egl: require wayland-egl.
