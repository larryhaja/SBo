wayland-egl (mesa EGL component)

The Wayland display server protocol uses EGL. If you build qt5 with
its optional dependency wayland and then build vlc then vlc will
require wayland-egl.

EGL is an interface between Khronos rendering APIs (such as OpenGL,
OpenGL ES or OpenVG) and the underlying native platform windowing
system. EGL handles graphics context management, surface/buffer
binding, rendering synchronization, and enables "high-performance,
accelerated, mixed-mode 2D APIs". EGL is managed by the non-profit
technology consortium Khronos Group.
