The GIMP Registry provides a location for GIMP plugins and scripts. These 
are individual projects to a certain extent, though they all have the 
GIMP in common.

This package takes its cue from the Debian gimp-registry-plugins 
package, though there are some differences as the scripts included
here are largely those which I wanted to use. If you want any 
particular plugins from the GIMP registry included, drop me an 
email.

This package includes: 

* Add Film Grain  
* Contact Sheet  
* Diana/Holga2  
* Exposure Blend
* GREYCstoration 
* Fake high dynamic range effect
* Smart Separate sharpen (redux)
* Rays of Light  
* Vignette Script
* Divide and deskew scanned images - optionally calls gimp-deskew-plugin

The scripts can be found as follows in the GIMP:
"Rays of Light" is in Filters > Alpha to Logo.
"Vignette" is in Filters > Light and Shadow.
"GREYCstoration" is in Filters > Enhance.
"Divide Scanned Images" has a single-use mode in Filters > Registry and
a batch processing mode in Filters > Batch Tools.
The rest of the plugins can be found in either
   Filters > Registry
or
   Filters > Photography
