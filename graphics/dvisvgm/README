dvisvgm is a fast DVI to SVG converter

The command-line utility dvisvgm is a tool for TeX/LaTeX users. It converts DVI
and EPS files to the XML-based scalable vector graphics format SVG. In contrast 
to bitmap graphics, vector graphics are arbitrarily scalable without loss of 
quality.

All modern web browsers support a large amount of the current SVG standard 1.1. 
Furthermore, SVG files can also be displayed with the Java-based Squiggle SVG 
browser which is part of the Apache Batik project, and the free vector 
graphics editor Inkscape.
