# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

geogit: geogit (Distributed version control for geospatial data)
geogit:
geogit: GeoGit is a distributed version control system specially designed to
geogit: handle geospatial data. GeoGit draws inspiration from Git, but adapts
geogit: its core concepts to handle versioning of spatial data. Users are able
geogit: to import raw geospatial data (such as Shapefiles, PostGIS or
geogit: SpatiaLite) into a repository where every change to the data is
geogit: tracked. These changes can be viewed in a history, reverted, branched
geogit: into sandboxed areas, merged back in or pushed to remote repositories.
