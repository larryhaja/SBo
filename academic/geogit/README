GeoGit is a distributed version control system specially designed to handle
geospatial data. GeoGit draws inspiration from Git, but adapts its
core concepts to handle versioning of spatial data. Users are able to import
raw geospatial data (such as Shapefiles, PostGIS or SpatiaLite) into a
repository where every change to the data is tracked. These changes can be
viewed in a history, reverted to older versions, branched into sandboxed
areas, merged back in or pushed to remote repositories.
