# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

qtoctave:
qtoctave: QtOctave is a graphical user interface for gnu octave, which is an
qtoctave: open source program alternative to Matlab.  With QtOctave you can do
qtoctave: perform computationally intensive mathematical tasks that would take
qtoctave: much longer to code in C or C++ or practically any other modern
qtoctave: computer language.  It is especailly good at matrix and vector
qtoctave: operations.  The graphical capabilities are very advanced.  It is
qtoctave: used heavily in engineering, and is a tool well worth learning.
