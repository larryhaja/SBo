FinchTV - A Brilliant Trace Viewer

Geospiza's FinchTV is the popular way to view DNA sequence traces.
FinchTV started as the only chromatogram viewer that can display an
entire trace in a scalable multi-pane view. And it leads the way with
raw data views, BLAST searching and the ability to reverse complement
sequences and traces.

This is just repackaging of the ready i386 binary. It WILL work on a
stock Slackware64 as well (no multilib needed).

NOTE!
This program is free, but you should REGISTER in order to get it.
This means you have to use a web browser to download the "source"
tarball.
