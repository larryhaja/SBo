SciDAVis (data analysis and visualization)

SciDAVis is a free interactive application aimed at data analysis and
publication-quality plotting. It combines a shallow learning curve and
an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interface with powerful
features such as scriptability and extensibility.

SciDAVis started as a fork of QtiPlot.

Optional dependencies, after installation, are scipy and pygsl (to
improve python scripting).

Note for Slackware-current

Since version 1.23 it is possible to build/use SciDAVis with Python 3
- just use PYTHON3=yes before executing scidavis.SlackBuild. Default is
to use python 2 (PYTHON3=no).
*** It does not build using Python 3 in Slackware 14.2 or previous
because the shipped PyQt was not built with Python 3 support. ***
