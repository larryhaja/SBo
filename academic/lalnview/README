LalnView is a graphical program for visualizing local alignments
between two sequences (protein or nucleic acids). Sequences are
represented by colored rectangles to give an overall picture of the
similarities between the two sequences. Blocks of similarity between
the two sequences are colored according to the degree of identity
between segments.
