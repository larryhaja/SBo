MEGA: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis

Sophisticated and user-friendly software suite for analyzing DNA and
protein sequence data from species and populations.

MEGA-CC is the command-line version of MEGA that implements its core
analysis functions and is useful for iterative and automated execution.
There are two executables: megacc and megaproto. Start with megaproto
which is used to create a MEGA Analysis Options (.mao) file that
specifies the analysis to run as well as relevant options. Then you call
megacc from a command shell and pass the .mao filename and input data
filenames as parameters. For example:

megacc -a myMaoFile.mao -d mySequenceAlignment.fas -o myOutput

To get started, checkout MEGA7-CC-User-Manual.pdf, found in the
documentation folder of the installed package.

This SlackBuild just repackages the binaries provided from upstream.
There are no 32bit executables.
