ROOT - A data analysis framework.

ROOT is a data analysis framework used mostly, but not limited to,
high energy physics. It was written in C++ by the techs at CERN to
explore the benefits of object oriented programming in physics data 
analysis. It consists of libraries, CINT or cling interpreter for
C/C++, plotting interface and powerful parellel processing support.
It is the preferred choice in many laboratories.

It comes with A LOT of different options for compilation. And it
seems impossible to stress all of them in this one script. Therefore
the potential user is strongly advised to check the configure
script.

The script was written to suit basic offline data analysis with
possible GSL and FFTW support with full documentation and tutorials.
It should be more than enough for normal user.

It has 2 optional dependencies: GSL (accessible from SlackBuilds)
and fftw (part of the official Slackware packages).

Script has also mathmore support, for which one needs to GSL.

Compilation takes quite a while.

To steer the SlackBuild script, run it with these variables:

GSL=yes(no) MATHMORE=yes(no) FFTW=yes(no) QT=yes(no) ./root.SlackBuild

where the values in brackets are the default values that will
be used unless specified otherwise.

Note that by default this script will install things in /usr/ROOT:
it will add /usr/ROOT/lib$LIBDIRSUFFIX to /etc/ld.so.conf and a
profile.d script to set the correct PATHs.
