SuiteSparseQR is an implementation of the multifrontal sparse QR
factorization method.  Parallelism is exploited both in the BLAS and
across different frontal matrices using Intel's Threading Building Blocks,
a shared-memory programming model for modern multicore
architectures.  It can obtain a substantial fraction of the
theoretical peak performance of a multicore computer.

This package is part of SuiteSparse.
