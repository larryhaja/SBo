suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving sparse
matrices.  The package includes the following libraries:

AMD: approximate minimum degree ordering.
BTF: permutation to block triangular form (beta).
CAMD: constrained approximate minimum degree ordering.
COLAMD: column approximate minimum degree ordering.
CCOLAMD: constrained column approximate minimum degree ordering.
CHOLMOD: sparse Cholesky factorization.
CXSparse: CSparse extended: complex matrix, int and long int support.
KLU: sparse LU factorization, primarily for circuit simulation.
LDL: a simple LDL^t factorization.
SQPR: a multithread, multifrontal, rank-revealing sparse QR factorization method.
UMFPACK: sparse LU factorization.
SuiteSparse_config:  configuration file for all the above packages.
RBio: read/write files in Rutherford/Boeing format.

Suitesparse is an optional dependency for the octave package.

NOTES:

* CHOLMOD can also be compiled to use the METIS library, but it is not
used here because its licensing terms exclude it from Octave.

* CXSparse is a superset of CSparse, and the two share common header
names, so it does not make sense to build both. CXSparse is built
by default.

* SlackBuilds.org also has all the parts of this suite as individual
builds - DO NOT try and install the individual parts and the suite;
pick one or the other.
