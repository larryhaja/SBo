pgRouting extends the PostGIS / PostgreSQL geospatial database to provide
geospatial routing functionality.

The following algorithms are compiled:
* Dijkstra - shortest path algorithm
* A-star (A*) - shortest path algorithm using heuristical function
* Shooting star (Shooting*) - shortest path algorithm for real road
  networks with turn restrictions, traffic lights and one way streets

A script for creating a pgRouting database template on Slackware will be
added to the documentation directory.
