STAR aligns short and long RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using
uncompressed suffix arrays, resulting in fast, accurate mapping.
STAR is capable of unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions,
can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts and
can map full-length RNA sequences.
