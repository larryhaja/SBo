Window_Manager_Scripts (WM Agnostic Shell Scripts)

Window-Manager-Scripts is a series of window manager agnostic shell
scripts. They're intended to be lightweight, relying on few deps as
possible and include a configuration file for easy customization.

Optional requirements: cURL recompiled with OpenSSL support for SFTP
image uploading, xclip to copy the uploaded image URL to clipboard,
and xwinwrap if you want to use video backgrounds.

Note: Copy ".xyscripts" from /usr/doc/Window_Manager_Scripts-$VERSION,
place it in your home directory, and customize it your liking.
