JOSM is an extensible editor for OpenStreetMap (OSM) written in Java 1.6.

Currently it supports loading stand-alone GPX tracks and GPX track data from the
OSM database as well as loading and editing existing nodes, ways, metadata tags
and relations from the OSM database. 

Untested for 64-bit. Please inform me if it works.
