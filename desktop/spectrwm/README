Spectrwm is a small dynamic tiling window manager for X11. It tries to stay out
of the way so that valuable screen real estate can be used for much more
important stuff. It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a
language to do any configuration. It was written by hackers for hackers and it
strives to be small, compact and fast.

This package installs an example spectrwm.conf, which contains a fair number of
options and default values. Also, there are example scripts for the bar_action
configure option, that can be used (perhaps after further customization) on
Slackware to display CPU, memory, wifi link, battery and X11 keyboard layout.
Further information about this can be found in the package's documentation
directory.
