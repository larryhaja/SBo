Qtile is simple, small, and extensible. It's easy to write your own
layouts, widgets, and built-in commands. Qtile is written and configured
entirely in Python, which means you can leverage the full power and
flexibility of the language to make it fit your needs.

NOTE: requiring rebuild Slackware's pycairo with
additional configure option --enable-xcb.
