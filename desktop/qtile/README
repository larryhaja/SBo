qtile is a full-featured, pure-Python tiling window manager:
- it's simple, small and extensible.
- it's easy to write you own layouts, widgets and commands.
- it's configured in Python.
- it has a command shell that allows all aspects of Qtile to be
  managed and inspected.
- complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces,
  manipulate windows, update status bar widgets and more: this makes
  it one of the most thoroughly unit-tested window mangers around.

NOTE: for this to run you need to rebuild Slackware's pycairo with
the additional configure option --enable-xcb.
