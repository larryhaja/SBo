paper-gtk-theme (Paper Theme Suite)

Paper is a modern desktop theme suite. Its design is mostly flat with
a minimal use of shadows for depth.

Paper has been developed primarily with modern GTK3 (GNOME-based)
desktop environments in mind, legacy-toolkit and GTK2 environments
will not provide an ideal experience, as much of the visual design
relies on modern GTK3+ widgets.
