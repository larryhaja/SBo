CurseTheWeather is a python application which displays the weather in a 
terminal via a ncurses frontend (ctw).  This frontend shows ascii-art weather 
icons along with the current weather conditions and 10 day forecast.

weatherfeed.py is the python module that grabs the weather data from 
weather.com, and it can used by frontends other than ctw.

** ctw and Transparency, Different Colors **

To modify transparency and color behavior in ctw simply modify 
initColors() in /usr/bin/ctw.  

To remove transparency, simply delete:
  curses.use_default_colors()
at line 125 (just under "curses.start_color()").

Modifying the lines with "curses.init_pair" will allow you to modify the text 
colors used.
