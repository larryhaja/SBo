awesome highly configurable, extensible tabbing window manager

awesome is a highly configurable, next generation framework window
manager for X. It is very fast, extensible and licensed under the
GNU GPLv2 license.

It is primarly targeted at power users, developers and any people
dealing with every day computing tasks and who want to have
fine-grained control on theirs graphical environment.

NOTE: To build/use this you need to rebuild Slackware's cairo enabling
xcb support: you have to edit the SlackBuild adding the line

  --enable-xcb \

to the configure parameters. Do it at your own risk (it's not yet
considered stable in the cairo shipped with slackware-14.0).
