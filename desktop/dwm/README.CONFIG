README.CONFIG for dwm

In tiled layout, windows are managed in a master and stacking area.
The master area contains the windows which currently need most
attention, whereas the stacking area contains all other windows. In
floating layout, windows can be resized and moved freely. Dialog
windows are always managed floating, regardless of the layout
selected.

Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or
multiple tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with those
tags.

dwm contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the
layout, the title of the focused window, and the text read from the
name of the root window. The selected tags are highlighted with a
different color, while the tags of the focused window are highlighted
with a small point.

dwm draws a small border around windows to indicate their focus state.

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
If you wish to make changes to the default keybindings or other
settings, produce a patch against config.h.
config.h is a copy of config.def.h distributed with the source
tarball.

Place any patches in the patches/ directory before starting the
SlackBuild script. A sample patch is included that will change
the default terminal from 'uxterm' to 'st'.
This video shows how I created the patch:

Example:

$ cd dwm-6.0
$ cp config.def.h config.h
$ vi config.h
[make customizations]
$ diff -u config.h config.def.h >> ../patches/config.patch
$ cd ..
$ sh dwm.SlackBuild
