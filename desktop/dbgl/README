DBGL serves as a frontend / Graphical User Interface to DOSBox
(configuration). It tries to make creating DOSBox configuration files
a little easier by offering a (relatively) simple interface, some
shortcuts and a little bit of intelligence (DOSBox behavior).
Once your DOS games are configured in DBGL, its very easy to setup or
start them, or alter their configuration or associated DOSBox version.

Note: this works with both 'dosbox' and 'dosbox-dev' packages available
      at SBo, at least one of them must be installed.
