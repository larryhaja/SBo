tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but should
also work with other window managers.  It's based off ttm code.

The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with lightweight code and
compliance with freedesktop specifications.

On the first run, /etc/xdg/tint2/tint2rc is copied to ~/.config/tint2/tint2rc
and used as the default configuration.

You can enable/disable some features by editing the script. The defaults are:

	TINT2CONF_BUILD=OFF
	BATTERY_PLUGIN=ON
	ADD_EXAMPLES=OFF
