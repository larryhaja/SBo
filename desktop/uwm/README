The UDE-Project is creating a new WM which will be a complete GUI in future.
The project does not use any special GUI-Libraries such as QT or GTK+. It just
uses the standard Xlibs (both to keep UDE fast and slim and to avoid
dependencies).

UDE has a completely original Look'n'Feel, it's not just another copy of the
so well known "classical" window management user interface.

System wide configuration files are in /usr/share/uwm/config/.
User specific configuration files are in $HOME/.ude/config/.

HTML documentation is provided in /usr/doc/uwm-0.2.11a/html/.
