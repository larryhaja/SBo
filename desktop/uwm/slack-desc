# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

uwm:
uwm: The UDE-Project is creating a new WM which will be a complete GUI in
uwm: the future. The project does not use any special GUI-Libraries such
uwm: as QT or GTK+. It just uses the standard Xlibs (both to keep UDE fast
uwm: and slim and to avoid dependencies).
uwm:
uwm: UDE has a completely original Look'n'Feel, it's not just another copy
uwm: of the so well known "classical" window management user interface.
