This contains a collection of near 300 Slackware-dedicated or otherwise
related wallpapers. The images are placed in /usr/share/wallpapers to
make xscreensaver happy :)

I am not the author of these! I just gathered what I already had
around or have found meanwhile. Any additions are very welcome!

NOTE: the unarchived size of this is around 150 MB.
