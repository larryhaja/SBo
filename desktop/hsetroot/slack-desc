# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hsetroot: hsetroot (Wallpapersetter)
hsetroot:
hsetroot: hsetroot is a tool which allows you to compose wallpapers ("root
hsetroot: pixmaps") for X. It has a lot of options like rendering gradients,
hsetroot: solids, images but it also allows you to perform manipulations on
hsetroot: those things, or chain them together. You could use one standard
hsetroot: background image for isntance, and using tint to make it fit your
hsetroot: current theme. And yes, of course it is compatible with
hsetroot: semi-translucent applications like aterm and xchat.
