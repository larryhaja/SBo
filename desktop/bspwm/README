bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the
leaves of a full binary tree. It is controlled and configured
via bspc.

before launching it, you need some configuration files: you can
can find some example ones in /usr/doc/bspwm-$VERSION/examples:
- bspwmrc, should go to ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
- sxhkdrc, should go to ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc

dmenu is an optional dependency.
