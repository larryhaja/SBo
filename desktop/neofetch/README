neofetch is a script that gathers information about your system and
prints it to the terminal next to an image, a distro's logo or any ASCII
art of your choice.

Optional dependencies:

- Desktop Environment and Window Manager: xprop
- Displaying images: w3m-img [1] [2]
- Thumbnail creation: imagemagick
- Displaying song information from Google Play Music Desktop Player:
- gpmdp-remote (https://github.com/iAndrewT/gpmdp-remote)

- Wallpaper: feh, nitrogen or gsettings (just choose one)
- Current Song: mpc, cmus, moc, spotify, gpmdc (choose one)
- Resolution: xorg-xrandr or xorg-xdpyinfo [3]
- Screenshot: scrot [4]


[1] w3m-img is sometimes bundled together with w3m.

[2] Image support only works in certain terminal emulators. The script
    will fallback to ascii mode on terminal emulators that don't support
    the xterm escape sequences we're using for image sizing.

[3] Xrandr is prefered over xdpyinfo as Xrandr supports multi monitor
    and refresh rate display in the output.

[4] You can use the launch flag `--scrot_cmd` or change the config
    option '$scrot_cmd' to your screenshot program's cmd and neofetch
    will use it instead of scrot.
