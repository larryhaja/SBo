mcwm is a minimalist window manager for the X Window System written
directly on top of the X protocol C-language Binding, XCB. It is a
traditional floating window manager with no fancy smarts like those in
modern tiling window managers.

In mcwm all functions are available from the keyboard but a pointing
device can be used for move, resize and raise/lower.

Features:

  * Small.
  * Fast.
  * No icons. (But it can hide windows completely.)
  * Sloppy focus.
  * Toggling vertical and full screen maximizing.
  * Virtual screens/workspaces.
  * Crash proof window placement.
  * Only users can move and resize windows.
  * Multihead support.
  * Good keyboard control.
  * No garish decorations (only 1 pixel border by default).
  * Written in straight C (C99).
  * Written using only XCB.
  * Few dependencies.
