wmtime (time dockapp for WindowMaker)

WMTime, guess what, displays the time and date and gives you
some nice additional features too...

wmtime supports several languages for displaying the days of the week and
month names. By default, "us" (aka English) is used. This can be changed
by setting LANGUAGE in the script's environment. Supported languages are:

de
es
fr
nl
slovene
us

To change the language after package installation, you can adjust the
symlink at /usr/share/wmtime/language.
