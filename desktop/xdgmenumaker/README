xdgmenumaker is a command line tool, written in python, that generates
application menus using xdg information, by scanning *.desktop files
in all $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications directories. All applications are
sorted according to the main categories as specified by freedesktop.org.

The menu entries that are generated by xdgmenumaker are localised
according to the running user locale settings.

xdgmenumaker currently supports generating menus for fluxbox, icewm and
windowmaker.
