# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rofi: rofi (window switcher)
rofi:
rofi: A popup window switcher roughly based on superswitcher, requiring
rofi: only xlib and xft. This version started off as a clone of
rofi: simpleswitcher, the version from Sean Pringle. All credit for this
rofi: great tool should go to him. Rofi developed extra features, like
rofi: a run-dialog, ssh-launcher and can act as a drop-in dmenu
rofi: replacement, making it a very versatile tool.
