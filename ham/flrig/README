Flrig is a transceiver control program for Amateur Radio use.  It does
not use any 3rd party transceiver control libraries.  It is a c++ pro-
gram that encapsulates each transceiver in it's own class.  Where ever
possible the transceiver class(s) use polymorphism to reuse code that
is portable across a series of transceivers.
