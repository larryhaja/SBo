Puddletag is a audio tag editor for GNU/Linux similar to the Windows
program Mp3tag. Unlike most taggers for GNU/Linux, it uses a spreadsheet-
like layout so that all the tags you want to edit by hand are visible and
easily editable.

Optional / Recommended packages are: gst-ffmpeg, gst-plugins-bad,
gst-plugins-ugly, gst-python, quodlibet, and chromaprint.
