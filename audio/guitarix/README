guitarix offers the range of sounds you would expect from a full-featured
universal guitar-amp. You can get crisp clean-sounds, nice overdrive,
fat distortion and a diversity of crazy sounds never heard before.

meterbridge is an optional runtime dependency.

Guitarix can be used as a standalone application, as LADSPA plugins,
or as LV2 plugins. By default, standalone and LADSPA are built. To also
build LV2 plugins, set LV2=yes in the script's environment (you will
need lilv installed). The script author hasn't tested LV2 support.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
