guitarix is a simple Linux Rock Guitar Amplifier for jack (Jack Audio
Connection Kit) with one input and two outputs. Designed to get nice
thrash/metal/rock/blues guitar sounds. There are controls for bass, middle,
treble, gain (in/out), compressor, preamp, tubes, drive, overdrive,
oversample, etc.

meterbridge is an optional runtime dependency.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
