guitarix offers the range of sounds you would expect from a full-featured
universal guitar-amp. You can get crisp clean-sounds, nice overdrive, fat
distortion and a diversity of crazy sounds never heard before. Guitarix
can be used as a standalone application, as LADSPA plugins, or as LV2
plugins.

For 32-bit x86, a CPU with SSE instructions is required. For other
architectures, SSE will be used if available.

meterbridge is an optional runtime dependency.

Starting with version 0.34.0, guitarix can browse and download presets
from the web, using the 'Online' button in the preset selector. To
enable this feature, install webkitgtk before building guitarix (it will
be autodetected).

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
