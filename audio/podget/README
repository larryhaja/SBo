Podget is a simple podcast aggregator optimized for running as a scheduled
background job (i.e. cron). It features support for downloading podcasts
from RSS & XML feeds, for sorting the files into folders & categories, for
importing URLs from iTunes PCAST files & OPML lists automatic M3U & ASX
playlist creation, and automatic cleanup of old files.  It also features
automatic UTF-16 conversion for podcasts hosted on MS Windows servers.

Run podget once to install the configuration files to $HOME/.podget,
and then customize them there.
