# Fix mandir and remove setting of ownership during install
# The mandir can easily be changed by passing a 'mandir' variable to the
# 'make install' process, but the setting of ownership isn't so easy to
# work around without a patch.  This isn't an issue if the SlackBuild
# script is run as root, but I'm guessing that I'm not the only person who
# likes to test a script as normal user before running it as root, and the
# ownership setting in the Makefile will break installs as a normal user.

patch -p1 < $CWD/Makefile.diff

# fix to mailx call: the command was using the -a option which, in Slackware's
# mailx, means something different than what was intended here (intent here is
# to set content type to UTF-8. In Slackware the -a is unnecessary. Thanks to
# Andreas Vogele for this patch. --gbecker
