pianobar is a console client for the personalized web radio pandora
(http://www.pandora.com).

- play and manage (create, add more music, delete, rename, ...) your stations
- rate played songs and let pandora explain why they have been selected
- show upcoming songs/song history
- configure keybindings and text output
- remote control and eventcmd interface (send tracks to last.fm, for example)
- proxy support for listeners outside the USA

Included with this SlackBuild is a helper script called pianobarctl that 
allows the user to remotely control some pianobar functions.  To use 
this a FIFO must first be created by the user:
   mkfifo ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

Please see man pianobar and pianobarctl --help for more information.
