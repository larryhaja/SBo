synthv1 (an old-school polyphonic synthesizer)

synthv1 is an an old-school 4-oscillator subtractive polyphonic
synthesizer with stereo fx. It runs either as a standalone JACK
application or an LV2 instrument plugin.

Optional dependency: The LV2 instrument plugin requires lv2 to be
installed (auto-detected at compile time).

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
