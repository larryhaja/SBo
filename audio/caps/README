caps (audio plugin suite for LADSPA)

CAPS, the C* Audio Plugin Suite, is a collection of refined LADSPA audio
plugins capable of (and mainly intended for) realtime operation. The suite
includes DSP units emulating instrument amplifiers, stomp-box classics,
versatile 'virtual analogue' oscillators, fractal oscillation, reverb,
equalization and more.

By default, CAPS will use SSE and/or SSE3 optimizations, if they are
supported on the build host. If you're building a package to be deployed
on a different system, you might need to set FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes in
the script's environment (this will completely disable SSE/SSE3).

The CAPS HTML documentation is about 1MB in size, located in
/usr/doc/caps-$VERSION/html/index.html. If you want to leave it out
of the package (e.g. if you're building for an embedded system), set
DOCS=no in the script's environment.
