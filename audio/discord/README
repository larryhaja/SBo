Discord is a command line program used to generate binaural, phase, and
chronaural beats mixed with tones, noise, or sound files of the users
choice. The default is to play the files via the computer's sound card,
but they can be written to an output file instead. Only file formats
available in libsndfile can be used as input or output.

The SVN version includes recent features. To use this, pass SVN=yes option
"discord-svn" and "discord" are available on /usr/bin with SVN version.

WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

If used consistently (a half hour or more per day) over long periods
of time (months, years), listening to brainwave entrainment beats will
cause psychological change, and might cause profound psychological
change. Presumably that is why you are doing this, but now it is explicit.

If you are consciously aware of, or consciously suspect, that you have
severe psychological traumas that you have repressed, do not use brainwave
entrainment beats until you have resolved the traumas or are comfortable
that you can deal with them if they become conscious.
