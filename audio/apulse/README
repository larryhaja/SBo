PulseAudio emulation for ALSA.

Any app that requires pulseaudio can be run as such:

    $ apulse <program> [parameters]

PulseAudio is not required.

The SlackBuild now detects a multilib machine and will 
build with COMPAT32 libraries. If you have a reason
to bypass this, run:

    # COMPAT32=no sh apulse.SlackBuild
