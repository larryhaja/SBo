PulseAudio emulation for ALSA.

Any app that requires pulseaudio can be run as such:

    $ apulse <program> [parameters]

PulseAudio is not required.

Speex is recommended for greater compatibility.

The SlackBuild now detects a multilib machine and will 
build with COMPAT32 libraries. If you have a reason
to bypass this, run:

    # COMPAT32=no sh apulse.SlackBuild

The default is for libraries to be installed in:

    /usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}/apulse

To override this setting and install the libraries 
directly into the /usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}/ directories, run:

    GLOBAL_LIBS=yes sh apulse.SlackBuild

This may increase pulseaudio compatibility with 
some applications. The disadvantage of this 
'global' build type, is that some programs (such as 
Google Chrome) will believe you have pulseaudio 
installed and may not have sound.
