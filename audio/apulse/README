PulseAudio emulation for ALSA.

Any app that requires pulseaudio can be run as such:

    $ apulse <program> [parameters]

PulseAudio is not required.

To install this on a multilib machine with 32-bit compatibility
libraries, run the SlackBuild preceded by COMPAT32=yes, like so:

    # COMPAT32=yes sh apulse.SlackBuild
