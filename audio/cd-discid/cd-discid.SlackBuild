# Apply a patch to Makefile to fix mandir and prevent setting ownership during
# the install.  The mandir could easily be done by passing the 'mandir'
# variable to 'make install' but the ownership setting can't be omitted any
# other way.  This isn't a huge issue, but I'm probably not the only one who
# likes to test scripts as a normal user before running them as root, and the
# ownership setting has to be removed for that to work.  --rworkman
