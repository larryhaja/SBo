A Sequenced Binaural Wave Generator for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
May be used to generate sounds that entrain the brain's waves to
oscillate at selected frequencies to aid in relaxation, lucid dreaming,
meditation, clear thought, out-of-body experiences and more.

NOTE: SBaGen can run script sequences with mp3 and ogg backgrounds
using reserved libraries (libmad.so/libvorbisidec.so.1).
To use this,  pass NONFREE=yes option to SlackBuild script (requires libvorbisidec).

SBaGen is run only with OSS. Use 'sbagen-oss' to play script sequences.
