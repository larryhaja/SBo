Pd-extended (Pure Data, by Miller Puckette) is a real-time audio 
synthesis/processing package.  It is one of the "MUSIC N" family 
members, open source (BSD style) successor of the MAX branch.  
This package contains the core of Pd and many external objects.

Since this version, the program binary's name is pdextended; in 
order to start Pd-extended, you have to call it with this name.

Pd-extended is usually based on an older version of Pd.  Since 
version 0.42.5 Pd-extended doesn't conflict any more with Pd.

You find an example for $HOME/.pdextended in the usual documentation
directory (named "example.pdextended"), which should work as is one
most machines and will enable most of the external libraries in pd.

To start Pd-extended, type "pdextended" on 32 bit boxes, and use
"pdextended64" on 64 bit boxes.

ftgl is an optional dependency.
