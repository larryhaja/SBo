Volume.app -- a simple windowmaker volume control dockapp
==========================================================================

This is a simple volume control for the AfterStep / BlackBox / Window
Maker dock. Volume.app is intended to be an extremely simple, efficient, and
attractive interface to a system's sound mixer.

Currently, only OSS mixer interface is supported. ALSA mixer can be used through 
ALSA's OSS emulation.



==========================================================================
NOTE1: look into "config.h.in" to set some options as needed;

NOTE2: If the system is on "ALSA's OSS emulation" and the app didn't run OK,
       remove the package and re-create it with those procedures:

       'cat /proc/asound/oss/sndstat' and search the "Mixers" section.
        locate the desired 'mixer number' and then modify file "config.h.in",
        at "DEFAULT_MIXER_DEVICE" parameter. Then, re-create the package.
      
        Eg: if desired mixer is "2", modify "config.h.in" as below:
       
            DEFAULT_MIXER_DEVICE "/dev/mixer"
               ( to )
            DEFAULT_MIXER_DEVICE "/dev/mixer2"
