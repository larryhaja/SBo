sonic-visualiser (audio file visualiser)

Sonic Visualiser is an application for viewing and analysing the contents
of music audio files. The aim of Sonic Visualiser is to be the first
program you reach for when want to study a musical recording rather than
simply listen to it.

Optional dependencies, detected at build time:

liblo     - allows remote control of sonic-visualiser via OSC.
portaudio - allows sonic-visualiser to run without a JACK or pulseaudio
            server.

Note: the SlackBuild author is unable to get sonic-visualiser 2.5 or
3.0.1 to work with PulseAudio or PortAudio. Only jack-audio-connection-kit
works. If you have problems with the other sound backends, try JACK.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
