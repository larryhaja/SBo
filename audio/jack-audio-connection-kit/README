JACK is a low-latency audio server written primarily for Linux.  It can
connect a number of different applications to an audio device, as well as
allow them to share audio among themselves.  Its clients can run in their
own processes (ie. as a normal application) or they can run within a JACK
server instance (i.e. as a "plugin").

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.

Optional dependencies are libffado and celt.
