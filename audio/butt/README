Optional dependency: jack-audio-connection-kit

Technically, you don't HAVE to compile this with lame for mp3 support, 
although that is the default of the configure script and so of this 
slackbuild. If you want to not support mp3, then you can exclude lame 
and set --without-mp3 as a configure option.
