ngjackspa (JACK host for LADSPA plugins)

ngjackspa is a set of simple user interfaces that host a LADSPA plugin,
providing JACK ports for its audio inputs and outputs, and dynamic setting
of its control inputs. Additionally, the plugin controls can be exported
to or controlled by control voltages on standard JACK audio ports.

By default, the Qt user interface is built, and the gtkmm UI is disabled.
To disable Qt, set QT=no in the script's environment. To enable gtkmm,
set GTKMM=yes (this will require gtkmm to be installed, of course).

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
