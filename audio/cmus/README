cmus (ncurses based music player)

cmus is a small and fast text mode music player
for Linux and many other UNIX like operating systems.

Optional dependencies (autodetected) are ffmpeg, libmpcdec,
faad2, libcue, libmp4v2 and pulseaudio.

It can be built also over roar-audio and opus-file (but ATM
these aren't available at SlackBuilds.org).
