cmus (ncurses based music player)

cmus is a small and fast text mode music player
for Linux and many other UNIX like operating systems.

Optional dependencies (autodetected) are ffmpeg, libmpcdec,
faad2, libcue and libmp4v2.

It can be built also over roar-audio (but ATM this isn't
available at Slackbuilds.org).
