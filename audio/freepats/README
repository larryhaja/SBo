freepats is a free and open set of instrument patches.  A patchset is
required for MIDI files to be audible through TiMidity++.  These patches
also work with applications that use SDL_mixer for MIDI audio.

You can also use crude.cfg instead of freepats.cfg in /etc/timidity.cfg
to use substitute patches that fill in missing entries in the tone bank.
