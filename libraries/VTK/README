The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available
software system for 3D computer graphics, modeling, image processing,
volume rendering, scientific visualization and information
visualization. VTK also includes ancillary support for 3D interaction
widgets, two and three-dimensional annotation, and parallel
computing. At its core VTK is implemented as a C++ toolkit, requiring
users to build applications by combining various objects into an
application. The system also supports automated wrapping of the C++
core into Python, Java and Tcl, so that VTK applications may also be
written using these interpreted programming languages.

VTK provides several language bindings. You may need to modify related
cmake options. Only Qt binding is enabled by default.
