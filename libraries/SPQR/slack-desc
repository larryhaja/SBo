# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

SPQR: SuiteSparseQR (sparse matrix factoring routines)
SPQR:
SPQR: SuiteSparseQR is an implementation of the multifrontal sparse QR
SPQR: factorization method.  Parallelism is exploited both in the BLAS
SPQR: and across different frontal matrices using Intel's Threading
SPQR: Building Blocks, a shared-memory programming model for modern
SPQR: multicore architectures.  It can obtain a substantial fraction of
SPQR: the theoretical peak performance of a multicore computer.
