Motif is the freely available source code distribution for the Motif 
user interface component toolkit.  Motif is built on top of the standard 
X Toolkit(Xt) and X11 libraries.

This the first motif version that is released under LGPL v2.1.

Postscript and PDF Documents (users guides and reference manuals) could be
downloaded at: http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/docs/

This conflicts with the lesstif package that comes with Slackware; in other
words, only one should be installed at any given time.  You will need to
recompile xpdf and any lesstif-dependent packages if you encounter problems
running them after installing motif.
