cfitsio is a library of ANSI C routines for reading and writing
FITS format data files. A set of Fortran-callable wrapper routines
is also included for the convenience of Fortran programmers.

The documentation directory contains a comprehensive API reference
guide and instructions on using cfistio in Fortran programs.

If you wish to build the library with the --enable-reentrant option,
run the SlackBuild script like this:
    CFITSIO_REENTRANT=yes ./cfitsio.SlackBuild

This option is disabled by default because some legacy software will
not link against reentrant libcfitsio.
