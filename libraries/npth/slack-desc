# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

npth: npth (New GNU Portable Threads Library)
npth:
npth: nPth is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a non-preemptive
npth: threads implementation.
npth: 
npth: In contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads
npth: implementation. This allows the use of libraries which are not
npth: compatible to GNU Pth. Experience with a Windows Pth emulation showed
npth: that this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based framework.
