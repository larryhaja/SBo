A generic input driver for the X.Org X11 X server based on libinput,
supporting all devices.
Serves as a wrapper needed by libinput to communicate with X.Org. 

Note that to have libinput properly operating on a Slackware 14.2
system, you also need this wrapper.

The package automatically places a default configuration file in
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-libinput.conf
To make sure that the driver takes precedence over any other drivers
that try to control your input devices, make sure that the number of
the above file is the highest of all the numbers in the same directory.
If you want to customize the default parameters of the driver,
modify the above file. Do not modify the system file in
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-libinput.conf

WARNING: Misconfiguration of an X input driver may leave you without
usable input devices in your X session. 
To fix the problem, boot to init level 3 (terminal, without starting X)
and make the appropriate fixes.
