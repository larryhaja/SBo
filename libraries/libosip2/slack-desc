# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libosip2: libosip2 (The GNU oSIP library)
libosip2:
libosip2: oSIP is an implementation of SIP. This library aims to provide
libosip2: multimedia and telecom software developers an easy and powerful
libosip2: interface to initiate and control SIP based sessions in their
libosip2: applications. oSIP is little in size and code and thus could be
libosip2: used to implement IP soft-phone as well as embedded SIP
libosip2: software. oSIP does not intend to provide a high layer API for
libosip2: controlling "SIP Session" at this step. Instead, it currently
libosip2: provides an API for the SIP message parser, SDP message parser,
libosip2: and library to handle "SIP transactions."
