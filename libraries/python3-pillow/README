The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to
your Python environment. This library provides extensive file format
support, an efficient internal representation and powerful image
processing capabilities.

NOTE - This SlackBuild provides PIL libraries with support for Python3. It
is intended to be a complement to Slackware's default python-pillow, not to
replace it, hence it doesn't include the scripts that would go to /usr/bin.
