libaaio is a software library providing the functionality of getch(),
getche() and kbhit() on Linux and UNIX systems (including Mac OS
X). It does not require an initialization (like curses) and does not
abuse the terminal (i.e.  whenever the mode of the terminal is changed
its state is stored so it can be restored).

The software has not seen any changes since 2005, but remains useful
for programs that still require it.  This build installs both the
static and shared libraries, as some programs still explicitly call
for the former.
