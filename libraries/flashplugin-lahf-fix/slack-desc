# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

flashplugin-lahf-fix: flashplugin-lahf-fix (Fix early x86_64 cpu missing LAHF instruction)
flashplugin-lahf-fix:
flashplugin-lahf-fix: Early x86_64 cpu's did not have the lahf instruction. Unfortunately,
flashplugin-lahf-fix: Adobe wrote their flash using this instruction.
flashplugin-lahf-fix: This fix basically traps interrupts to see if it's due to lahf
flashplugin-lahf-fix: missing, then either returns OK or let's the interrupt continue for
flashplugin-lahf-fix: further processing.
