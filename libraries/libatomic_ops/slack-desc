# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libatomic_ops: libatomic_ops (Atomic memory update operations)
libatomic_ops:
libatomic_ops: Provides implementations for atomic memory update operations
libatomic_ops: on a number of architectures. This allows direct use of these
libatomic_ops: in reasonably portable code. Unlike earlier similar packages,
libatomic_ops: this one explicitly considers memory barrier semantics, and
libatomic_ops: allows the construction of code that involves minimum overhead
libatomic_ops: across a variety of architectures.
