Grantlee is a set of Free Software libraries written using the Qt
framework. Currently two libraries are shipped with Grantlee: Grantlee
Templates and Grantlee TextDocument.

The goal of Grantlee Templates is to make it easier for application
developers to separate the structure of documents from the data they
contain, opening the door for theming and advanced generation of other
text such as code.
