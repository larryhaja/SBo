libdbusmenu (library for passing menus over DBus)

libdbusmenu is a small little library that was created by
pulling some common code out of indicator-applet.

It passes a menu structure across DBus so that a program
can create a menu simply without worrying about how it is
displayed on the other side of the bus.
