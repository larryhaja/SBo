# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dbh:
dbh: dbh is a library to create and manage 64-bit disk based hash tables,
dbh: which are a convenient way to associate unsigned character keys to
dbh: data records. Any kind of digital information can go into the data
dbh: record, such as text, graphic information, database structures, you
dbh: name it. The idea behind using a DBH is to build the key index
dbh: directly into a multidimensional file format.
