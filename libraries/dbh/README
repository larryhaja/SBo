dbh is a library to create and manage 64-bit disk based hash tables,
which are a convenient way to associate unsigned character keys to
data records. Any kind of digital information can go into the data
record, such as text, graphic information, database structures, you
name it. The idea behind using a DBH is to build the key index
directly into a multidimensional file format.
