Barry is a GPL C++ library for interfacing with the RIM BlackBerry Handheld. It
comes with a command line tool for exploring the device and a GUI for making
quick backups. This project's goal is to create a fully functional syncing
mechanism on Linux.

FYI, this slackbuild can take a variable of OPENSYNC (in addition to the
standard ARCH, TMP, BUILD, etc.), by default compiling barry with opensync
is disabled. passing OPENSYNC=<anything that isn't 'no'> will compile barry
with opensync support, which will require that opensync already be installed
(libopensync is in the SBo repository as well)
