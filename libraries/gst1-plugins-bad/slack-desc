# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gst1-plugins-bad:
gst1-plugins-bad: GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par
gst1-plugins-bad: compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality,
gst1-plugins-bad: but they're missing something - be it a good code review, some
gst1-plugins-bad: documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some
gst1-plugins-bad: actual wide use.
