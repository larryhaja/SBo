# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lapack-atlas: LAPACK-ATLAS (LAPACK customized for build against ATLAS)
lapack-atlas:
lapack-atlas: LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear
lapack-atlas: equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
lapack-atlas: eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. The associated matrix
lapack-atlas: factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are
lapack-atlas: also provided, as are related computations such as reordering of the
lapack-atlas: Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded
lapack-atlas: matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all areas,
lapack-atlas: similar functionality is provided for real and complex matrices, in
lapack-atlas: both single and double precision.
