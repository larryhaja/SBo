# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

itcl: itcl (object-oriented programming contructs to Tcl)
itcl:
itcl: [incr Tcl] provides the extra language support needed to build large
itcl: Tcl/Tk applications. It introduces the notion of objects, which act as
itcl: building blocks for an application. Each object is a bag of data with
itcl: a set of procedures or "methods" that are used to manipulate it.
itcl: Objects are organized into "classes" with identical characteristics,
itcl: and classes can inherit functionality from one another. This
itcl: object-oriented paradigm adds another level of organization on top of
itcl: the basic variable/procedure elements, and the resulting code is
itcl: easier to understand and maintain.
